**Key Terms :**
*Accuracy* - For results to be close to the true answer
*Precision* - For results to be close together
*Repeatable* - Precision when personally repeating experiment
*Reproducible* - Precision when others repeating experiment
*Percentage Uncertainty* - Absolute uncertainty as a percentage of the mean.

**Basic Equipment :**
- Ammeter
	- Wire in the COM 
	- Wire in the 10A 
	- Dial set to 10A *Direct no Alternating*
- Voltmeter
	- Wire in the COM 
	- Wire in the V
	- Dial set to 20 DCV *Direct no Alternating*

**Writing an experiment plan :**
- Draw a diagram detailing the equipment layout
- Compare equation given to $y=mx+c$ and say what graph you will plot, detail what gradient and y intercept will be
- Risk assessment
	- If there are significant risks detail the hazard (danger + why) , risk and control measure.
	- Else "There is no significant risk".
- Note trial readings have been recorded
- Brief method - include equipment used for measurement 
- The range of readings that you will take for the independent variable. Plan for 5 steps within range. Detail repeats (3-5).
