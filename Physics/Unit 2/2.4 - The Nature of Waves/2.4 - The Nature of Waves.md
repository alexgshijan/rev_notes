**Frequency :**$$f=\frac{1}{T}$$*where :*
- Frequency is $f$ with units $Hz$ or $s^{-1}$
- Time is $T$ with units $s$

**Wave energy :**$$\text{energy carried by wave}\propto\text{amplitude}^{2}$$**Wave velocity :**$$c=f\lambda$$*where :*
- Wave velocity is $c$ with units $ms^{-1}$
- Frequency is $f$ with units $Hz$ or $s^{-1}$
- Wavelength is $\lambda$ with units $m$

**Unpolarised Light :**
Where transverse light oscillates in an any of the infinite planes.

**Polarised Light :**
Where transverse light oscillates in a single plane
