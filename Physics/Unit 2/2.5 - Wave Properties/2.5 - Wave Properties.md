*Path difference - Interference patterns* - If the sum of distance in term of wavefront from each source is an integer, then it is constructive. 

**Interference of light**

S, $S_1$, and $S_2$, are narrow slits parallel to each other. Light is diffracted at S, which illuminates $S_1$, and $S_2$,, and the interference occurs in the region of overlap between the two diffracted beams. 

Since the two beams are effectively derived from the single source at S, they have the same frequency, same phase relationship, same amplitude and vibrate in the same direction, i.e. they are coherent. This produces an observable and stable interference pattern.

**Young's Double slit experiment**

A series of alternatively bright and dark bands which are equally paced and of equal width, can be observed on a screen placed anywhere in the region of overlap

**Young's Fringes Formula** - *D must be much greater than a and y*
$$\lambda=\frac{a\Delta y}{D}$$
*where :*
- Wavelength is $\lambda$ with units $m$
- Slit separation is $a$ with units $m$
- Distance between slit to screen is $D$ with units $m$
- Fringe width is $\Delta y$ with units $m$

*Diffraction is the spreading out of waves when they meet obstacles, such as the edges of a slit. Some of the wave's energy travels into the geometrical shadows of the obstacles*

When the wavelength of the wave is equal to or greater than the width of a slit, waves spread as roughly semi-circular wavefront
