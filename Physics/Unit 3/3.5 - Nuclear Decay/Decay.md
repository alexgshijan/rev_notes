*Alpha*
When an unstable nucleus decays by emitting an alpha particle it loses 4 nucleons so *its nucleon/mass number decreases by 4*. Since it also loses 2 protons, *its proton number decreases by 2.* A Helium neutron (Alpha particle) is also emitted.

*Beta*$^{-}$
This is the emission of an electron from the nucleus. A neutron changes to a proton, which stays in the nucleus and an electron (which is emitted as a β-particle). *This means that the proton number increases by 1, while the total nucleon number remains the same.* An electron (Beta particle) and anti-neutrino are also emitted.

*Beta*$^{+}$
This is the emission of a positron (electron anti-particle) from the nucleus. A proton changes to a neutron, which stays in the nucleus and positron (which is emitted as a $β^{+}$particle). This means that the *proton number decreases by 1, while the total nucleon number remains the same.*

**Decay Constant**
*The decay constant appears in the exponential decay law and determines the probability that an individual nucleus will decay within unit time, this value is constant for a specific nuclide*

**Formula**$$A=-\lambda N=-\frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t}$$*where :*
- A is Activity in units Becquerel (decay per second)
- $\lambda$ is the decays constant in units $s^{-1}$
- N is the number of un-decayed nuclei 
- t is time
