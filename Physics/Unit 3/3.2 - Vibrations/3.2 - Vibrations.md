*If both the following conditions are true, then you have simple harmonic motion*
- If you displace an object, there will be a restoring force back to equilibrium. 
- The bigger the displacement, the larger the restoring force.

*Factors affecting our pendulum*
- Length of pendulum
- Gravity

**Formula for pendulum system :**$$T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$$
**Formula for Mass-Spring system :**$$T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{M}{K}}$$
*where :*
- T is time period
- M is Mass
- K is spring constant
- g is gravity
- l is length of pendulum


**Formulae with phase**
$$x_{max}=A\to x=A\cos wt$$
$$v_{max}=-\omega A\to v=wA\sin wt$$
$$a_{max}=-\omega^{2}A\to a=w^{2}A\cos wt$$
*We can construct new formulae for phase shifts instead of having to account for it within the formulae*

*where :*
- A is amplitude
- x is displacement
- v is velocity
- a is acceleration
