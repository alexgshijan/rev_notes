*Mean square speed is a way of looking at the average kinetic energy and therefore average temperature of the fast molecules. We represent this is $\bar{c^{2}}$. We can then find the root mean squared speed, represented as $Rms \text{ or }\sqrt{\bar{c^{2}}}$*

**Deriving** $pV=\frac{Nm\bar{c^{2}}}{3}$
*Assume we have 1 particle, this particle hits wall with elastic collision and rebounds :*$$\therefore \Delta p=-mv-mv=-2mv$$
*Plug into N2L and considering N3L, to remove negative, we get the following*$$F=\frac{2mv}{t}$$
*Considering $x$ as the length of our space*$$t=\frac{2x}{v}\therefore F=\frac{2mv}{\frac{2x}{v}}=\frac{mv^{2}}{x}$$
*Then to turn this into a value for pressure where $yz$ are the other dimensions of our volume*$$p=\frac{F}{A}=\frac{\frac{mv^{2}}{x}}{yz}\therefore p=\frac{mv^{2}}{xyz}$$
*That value of P would give us the pressure for a single particle and in all 3 planes, so we multiply by the number of molecules and divide by 3.*$$\therefore p_{all}=\frac{Nmv^{2}}{xyz}\therefore p_{x}V=\frac{Nmv^{2}}{3}$$
*Finally consider that particles have random speed so we take an average*$$p=\frac{Nm\bar{c^{2}}}{3V}=\frac{\rho\bar{c^{2}}}{3}$$
