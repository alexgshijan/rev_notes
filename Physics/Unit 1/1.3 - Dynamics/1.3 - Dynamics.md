**Moment = Force x Perpendicular distance**

*It's important to make sure that the force and distance are at 90Ëš from each other*

We can use [[1.5 - Trigonometry]] to calculate the perpendicular distance if it isn't given to us in the question

**Principle of moments :** In equilibrium, the sum of the clockwise moments is equal to the sum of the anticlockwise moments 

**Types of Equilibrium :**
- Neutral - No matter the force applied, the centre of gravity remains on top of the pivot point. It cannot 'fall'
- Stable - The moment will bring the object back to it's original point after a force is applied
- Unstable - The moment will take the object away from it's original point after a force is applied

In an regular shape made of a single material, the centre of gravity would be the exact centre of the shape. 

However most objects are not truly uniform. The method of finding the centre of gravity of an irregular Lamina is plotting the stable equilibrium point on each dimension

An object will topple over if the line of action of its weight lies outside the base of the object. An object is more stable if it has a low centre of mass
