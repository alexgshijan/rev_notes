**When a particle and an antiparticle collide, they annihilate each other**
They disappear and their mass-energy converts into 2 photons $\gamma$ 

These photons are very high energy - *Equal to the sum of mass-energy and kinetic energy of the particles.*
*One photon conserves charge and mass/energy and the second photon conserves momentum*
If enough energy is released then new particles can be produced for a very short period of time

Particle energy is measured in electron volts $eV$
An $eV$ is the amount of energy transferred when an electron moves through a potential difference of 1 volt.

**Kinetic-Energy Formula :**$$W=QV$$*Where :*
- Work Done is represented by $W$
- Charge is represented by $Q$
- Voltage is represented by $V$

**Mass-Energy Formula :**$$E=mc^{2}$$*Where :*
- Mass-Energy is represented by $E$
- Mass is represented by $m$
- The speed of light is represented by $c$

*Note an antiparticle have the same Mass-Energy as its corresponding particle*
