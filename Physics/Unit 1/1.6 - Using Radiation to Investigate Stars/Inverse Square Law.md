Radiation from a star spreads out as it moves out.
The further away from the star, the bigger the area that amount of radiation has to cover.
This means it lowers the intensity of the radiation 

Formula :$$I=\frac{L}{4\pi r^2}$$Where $I$ is Intensity (Units : $Wm^{-2}$)
And L is Luminosity/ Total Power (Units : $W \text{ or } Js^{-1}$)
And $r$ is the distance travelled

*Think of this as the light from a star being dispersed as a sphere around the star*
