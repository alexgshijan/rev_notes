**Magnetic Flux**
These are the number of field lines passing through an area.
$$\phi=AB\cos\theta$$
where :
- A is the Area 
- B is the Magnetic Flux Density 
- Theta is the angle between the normal of the surface and the magnetic field 
- Phi is the Magnetic Field with units WB

**Magnetic Flux Linkage** - Consideration for Solenoids
$$\text{flux linkage}=N\phi$$
where : 
- N is the number of turns in the wire.

**Faraday‚Äôs and Len's Law**
An emf is induced if there is a change of magnetic flux. Faraday‚Äôs Law states that the emf induced is directly proportional to the rate of change of flux linkage. Lenz‚Äôs Law states that the direction of the current resulting from an induced emf opposes the change in flux linkage that caused it.
$$E=\frac{-\Delta N\phi}{\Delta t}=\frac{-\Delta NAB\cos\theta}{\Delta t}=-Bvl$$
where :
- E = induced emf (V)
- v is the velocity of conductor
- l is the length of the distance

**Induced Voltage Graph :** ![[Pasted image 20250320120005.png]]
1. Emf initially increases as rate of flux linkage increases
2. Emf decreases when the rate of increase drops
3. Emf is zero when the flux is max or in middle when no cutting
4. Emf reverses when S pole due to reversed magnetic field
5. The second peak is higher due to a higher speed

Note that Induced magnetic fields follow Flemming's right hand rule.

**Ways to induce an EMF**
- Varying B field ‚Üí transformers
- Varying area (through some sort of motion) ‚Üí conductor moving through B field 
- Varying the angle ùúÉ ‚Üí electrical generators
