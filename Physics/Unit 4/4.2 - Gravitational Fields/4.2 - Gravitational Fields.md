Gravity is quite a weak force and occurs between any objects with mass, it is always attractive. Spherical masses can be treated as though they are point masses with all their mass concentrated at their centre. The field is 0 at the centre of mass.

**Newton's Law of Gravitation**
Every body in the Universe attracts every other with a force that is inversely proportional to the square of their separation. This closely mirrors [[4.2 - Electrostatic Fields|Coulomb's Law]] 
$$F=-\frac{GmM}{r^{2}}$$
*where :*
- Force in Newtons 
- Masses in kg (Big M for big body.)
- Distance between bodies
- G is the gravitational constant $= 6.67 \cdot 10^{-11} Nm^{2}kg^{-2}$

*Note that repulsion has a positive force and attraction has a negative force*

**Gravitational Field Strength**
This is the Force experienced per unit mass by a mass placed in a field
$$g=\frac{F}{m}=\frac{GM}{r^{2}}=-\frac{\Delta V_{g}}{\Delta r}\implies\text{On Earth : }g=\frac{\text{weight of 1kg mass : }9.81}{1}=9.81 ms^{2}$$
**Gravitational Potential - $V_{g}$**
The work done per unit mass in bringing a mass from infinity to that point, the potential energy depends on both the field and the size of the mass. *Units $[Jkg^{-1}]$* $$V_{g}=-\frac{GM}{r}$$
**Gravitational Potential Energy**
The work done in bringing a mass from infinity to that point, the potential energy depends on both the field and the size of the mass. *Units $[J]$* $$PE=-\frac{GMm}{r}=m\Delta V_{g}=\text{ Work Done}$$
**Escape Velocity**
Minimum velocity at which a projectile is thrown upwards, never to return to Earth.
