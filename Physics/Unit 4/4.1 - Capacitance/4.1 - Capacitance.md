**Capacitors store and then release electrical energy (and charge). A dielectric separates the two plates of metal, these are air or a vacuum. This increases capacitance**

Capacitor plates must have a net charge of zero, so must be equal and opposite each other. [Diagram Attached](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/cap1.gif) . The leads connected to the plate become charged when a pd is applied, they have a large surface and the plates are normally rolled up like a Swiss roll.

**Capacitance Formula**
$$C=\frac{Q}{V}=\frac{\epsilon_{0}A}{d} $$
*Where :*
- C is the Capacitance in units F (Farad) or CV^1
- Q is the Charge on either plate 
- V is the potential difference between plates.
- A is the area 
- d is the distance between plates
- Epsilon is a constant.
*Charge on the plates is directly proportional to the capacitance and pd applied.*

**Charging up a capacitor**
- Connect to battery
- Initial surge of current whilst capacitor charges
- If battery removed, capacitor holds charge 
- Discharges by connecting the capacitor's leads together, a lot of current flows quickly.
- Current flows one way when charging and the other when discharging.
