**Dark Matter - Matter that we can't see or detect by any sort of radiation, but whose existence we infer from its gravitational effects.**

Consider the following observed rotational speed curve for a typical spiral galaxy, the calculated curve is predicted by taking into account observed normal matter in the galaxy. [Graph of expected vs actual rotational velocity](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alan-Parry/publication/258849339/figure/fig3/AS:669497048461332@1536631943465/The-rotation-curves-both-observed-and-calculated-for-the-Andromeda-galaxy-Credit.jpg)

However when measured, objects in spiral galaxies appear to travel too fast at large distance from the centre of the galaxy. As velocity is proportional to the square root of mass, this larger than expected speed *suggests that the galaxy contains hidden mass (more than observed)*. The mass within the galaxy is distributed across an area that extends well beyond just the central region of the galaxy. *The extra mass is attributed to dark matter.*

**Binary Body Systems**
Consider two spherically symmetric objects orbiting their mutual centre of mass.
- The centre of mass must be on the line joining the centres of the two objects and must be between the two objects as the centripetal acceleration is towards it
- The angular velocities of the objects are identical
**Formula**
$$r_{1}=\frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}d\hspace{1cm}r_{2}=\frac{m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}d$$
*where :*
- m represents the respective masses
- r represents the the respective distances from the centre of mass

**Luminosity-Time Graphs**
**Planet-Star Scenario**
We can use the minimum luminosity and Time Period of one oscillation to find the orbit and diameter of each body.

**Binary Star Scenario**
The intensity of light from eclipsing binary stars varies as shown on [this graph](https://cosmosatyourdoorstep.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ceafb739be6322649c8875ba91817af4.jpg). This information can be used to calculate the period of orbit and diameter of each star. We can recognise this in a Luminosity-Time graph with two unique minimums

**Hubble's Constant** $$v=H_{0}D$$
**Critical Density**
We can simulate different densities of the universe and how it effects the change of radius of the universe over time.

**Formula**
$$\rho_{c}=\frac{3}{8}\frac{H_{0}^{2}}{\pi G}$$
*Where :*
- H0 is Hubble's Constant 
- Rho is the critical density 
- G is the Universal Gravitational Constant
