Orbital velocity of a star can be broken into two components, the effect of the star's wobble and that of the big bang. The amplitude of the wave represents the orbital velocity, the offset from original wavelength represents the galactic recession velocity.

**Formula**
$$\frac{\Delta\lambda}{\lambda}=\frac{v}{c}$$
*where*
- delta lambda is the change in wavelength
- lambda is the reference wavelength
- v is the velocity
- c is the speed of light
