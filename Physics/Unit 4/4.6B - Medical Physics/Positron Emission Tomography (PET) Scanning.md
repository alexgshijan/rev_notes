**PET scans make use of the annihilation of matter and anti matter to measure the metabolic activity in a patients body.**

Glucose tagged with Fluorine-18 is injected into the body and this decays by positron emission. When the positron collides with an electron in the body, they annihilate and produce two gamma rays which move off in opposite directions.

The two gamma rays which move off in opposite directions are of identical wavelength, thus conserving momentum. A ring of detectors surrounds the body. Each detector is a scintillation crystal connected to a photomultiplier tube. Two detectors pick up the emitted gamma rays, so the annihilation event must have occurred along the line joining these two detectors.
