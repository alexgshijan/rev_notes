This device collects data on X-ray transmission at different angle through slices of a body to form a 3D picture. CT scans require a much longer exposure to radiation than a normal x-ray. Therefore, they are potentially more harmful than x-rays due to the greater exposure.

Advantages
- 3D Images
- Higher resolution â€“ reveal much more detail
- Able to produce images that distinguish between soft tissue well e.g. good for detecting tumours in the lungs

Disadvantages
- Expensive
- Increase radiation dose compared with normal x-rays
