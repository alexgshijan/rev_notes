MRI scanners can create images of the brain and most other body organs. They can also detect tumours.

MRI scanners work by making use of the billions of hydrogen atoms that are contained in the body. If a strong magnetic field is applied they tend to align themselves, in almost equal numbers, either with the field lines (in parallel) or exactly opposite to the field (antiparallel).

The nuclei do not align perfectly with the field, they rotate or precess around the field lines, due to thermal energies. All the protons will precess around the field lines at the same frequency (called the Larmor frequency).
$$f=4.26\cdot10^{6}\cdot B$$
If a pulse of radio waves, at the same frequency as they are precessing (Larmor frequency), is directed at the hydrogen nuclei, they will resonate and flip from one alignment to another.the nuclei do not align perfectly with the field, they rotate or precess around the field lines, due to thermal energies.

All the protons will precess around the field lines at the same frequency (called the Larmor frequency).

The excited protons are now in a semi stable state but when the radiowaves are switched off the nuclei relax and revert back to their original state giving off electromagnetic radiation (a radiowave) - relaxation time  is affected by the type of molecules around the hydrogen nuclei.
