[X-Ray Diagram](1.png). The heavy metal target is normally tungsten. X-rays are close to 1% efficient so a lot of care needs to be taken on cooling.

**X-ray production**
- The heater ‘boils off’ electrons by thermionic emission.
- These are then accelerated to very high velocities by the p.d. between the heater filament and anode.
- They are collimated by the focussing anode. 
- The tube is evacuated so the electrons travel in straight lines and collide with a tungsten target (the anode) embedded in a copper block.
- The resulting deceleration produces an enormous amount of heat (up to 99% of the energy input) and also X-rays, which emerge from a window in the lead housing.

**Manipulating the X-ray spectra**
- Changing the heavy metal component changes where you get the metal specific spikes
- The intensity of the X-ray beam depends on the number of electrons striking the target per second and is controlled by the filament current and operating p.d.
- The penetrating power of the x-rays (i.e. their maximum energy) is determined by the speed of the electrons and thus the accelerating voltage.
- The greater the accelerating voltage (voltage across the cathode and anode) the smaller the wavelength or higher the photon energy of the x-rays that are produced and the greater the penetrating power.
- Increasing the filament current or voltage will liberate more electrons so more electrons collide with the target per second.

**Formula**
$$E=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$$
So the greater the fraction of energy that the electrons lose the smaller
the wavelength of the emitted x-rays

**Intensity**
The minimum wavelength of x-rays that are produced depends entirely on the maximum energy of the photons that are decelerated when they hit the target.
$$\lambda_{min}=\frac{hc}{E_{max}}=\frac{hc}{eV}$$
where $hce$ are known constants plank, speed of light, charge of electron and V is pd

**Changing Materials**
As the proton number is increased: E max remains constant, as it's a function of the voltage;

The total intensity (the area under the graph) will change because there is a greater
probability of a collision between the incoming electron and the electron shells.
The more protons, the more electrons; The characteristic lines are shifted to higher photon energies.

**Attenuation of x-rays**
When X-rays pass through matter they are absorbed and scattered and therefore the beam is attenuated. This attenuation can be calculated using the equation: $$I=I_{0}e^{-\micro x}$$
*Where :*
- I = intensity at a depth x
- I_0 = intensity at the surface
- µ = the attenuation coefficient with units m^-1

**Half Value Thickness**
This is the thickness of the material which is needed to reduce the intensity (I) of the X ray beam to one half the intensity of the incident radiation (Io). Formula :
$$x_\frac{1}{2}=\frac{\ln 2}{\micro}$$

**Therapeutic use of X-Ray**
X-ray therapy is where high-energy radiation from x-rays is used to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors.

**Diagnostic use of X-Ray**
You can look for soft tissue by using a contrast medium to change the density of the soft tissue
