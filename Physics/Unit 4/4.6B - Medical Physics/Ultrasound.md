Ultrasound is the name given to sound waves that are above the range of human hearing i.e. above 20kHz. Ultrasound can be generated using piezoelectric crystals. If you apply an alternating p.d. across the crystal you cause it to become deformed, with the crystal vibrating at the same frequency as the applied p.d. 

The process also works in reverse, with the crystal receiving ultrasound and converting it to an alternating p.d. The crystal, then, can act as both an emitter and a receiver of ultrasound.

The absorber damps the sound waves from the piezoelectric crystal which would be sent back into the transducer and therefore, short pulses of ultrasound waves are sent in the correct direction out of the nose of the transducer only.

**Acoustic Impedance**
An ultrasound scan depends on pulses of sound being partially reflected and partially transmitted at tissue boundaries. The acoustic impedance determines how much energy (ultrasound) is reflected at a boundary. If two materials have a large difference in Z then a lot of the energy will be reflected back, but if there is little or no difference in Z then there will be little or no reflection.
$$Z=c\rho$$
Where :
- Z is the acoustic impedance of the material with units $kgm^{-2}s^{-1}$
- c is the speed of the speed of sound 
- rho is the density of the material

**Reflection Coefficient**
The reflection coefficient R is the fraction of the ultrasound energy that is reflected:
$$\frac{I_{r}}{I_{o}}=R=\frac{(Z_{2}-Z_{1})^{2}}{(Z_{2}+Z_{1})^{2}}$$
Coupling medium - Gel or oil used to exclude air between the skin and the ultrasound transducer. It reduces the mismatch in Z, and enables more ultrasound to enter the body instead of being reflected off the skin.

**Ultrasonic A-scan**
Scan in which the strength of reflections of an ultrasound pulse from interfaces in the body is shown by the amplitude of a trace. A-scans are usually used when the anatomy of the section is well known but the precise depth is needed. These types of scan are 1 dimensional.

**Ultrasonic B-scan**
Scan in which the strength of reflection of an ultrasound pulse from interfaces in the body is shown by the brightness of a trace. An array of transducers can produce a two dimensional picture. This is widely used to assess the health and growth of a prenatal foetus.

**Doppler Ultrasound**
Doppler Effect : Change in frequency of waves due to the relative motion of wave source, sensor, medium or reflector. 

A continuous source of ultrasound is sent out and its echo received back off a moving object such as blood cells. Because the blood cells are moving, the Doppler shift is doubled: once for the blood cells receiving the ultrasound and once for the blood cells acting as transmitters back to the stationary receiver.

This technique will show up any changes in the blood flow through a vein or artery and so can be used to detect clots or thrombosis.
$$\frac{\Delta f}{f_{0}}=\frac{2v}{c}\cos\theta$$
where : 
- delta f is the shift in frequency of the ultrasound
- f_0 is the initial frequency of the ultrasound 
- c is speed of the ultrasound 
- v is speed of blood flow
