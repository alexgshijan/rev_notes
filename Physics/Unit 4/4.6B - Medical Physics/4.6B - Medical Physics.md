**Definitions**
- The sievert (Sv): This is the unit of equivalent dose and effective dose. (1Sv = 1Jkg-1)
- Equivalent dose, H: This is the absorbed dose, D, multiplied by a radiation weighting factor, WR.
- Effective dose, E: This is the equivalent dose, H, multiplied by a tissue weighting factor WT.

**Radiation Weighting Factor**

| Radiation | Weighting Factor |
| --------- | ---------------- |
| Alpha     | 20               |
| Beta      | 1                |
| Gamma     | 1                |
| X-Ray     | 1                |
