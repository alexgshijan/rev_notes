*For a continuous variable the probability function is known as the probability density function, written as f(x).* We can calculate this value by finding the integral of the function, and by knowing the probability over the full range is equal to 1, we can calculate any unknown coefficients within our probability. Eg.
$$f(x)=kx^{2} \hspace{0.5cm}0\leq x\leq 4\hspace{0.5cm}\to\hspace{0.5cm}\int_{0}^{4}{kx^{2}}=1\to k=\frac{3}{64}$$
$$\text{The Expected Value }E(x):\mu=\int_{limit}^{limit}{xf(x)}\hspace{0.25cm}dx\implies E(x^{2})=\int_{limit}^{limit}{x^{2}f(x)}\hspace{0.25cm}dx$$
