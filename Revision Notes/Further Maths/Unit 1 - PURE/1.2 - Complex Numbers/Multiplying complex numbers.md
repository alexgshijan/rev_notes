$$z_{1}\cdot z_{2}=z_{1}\text{ scaled up by }|{z_{2}}| \text{, rotated by argument-angle}$$
*Dividing complex numbers works in a similar way. You obtain the vector z1/z2 by enlarging the vector z1 by the scale factor $\frac{1}{|z2|}$ and rotate it clockwise through an angle of arg($z_{2}$).*

**Multiplying and dividing using the Trigonometric Form**
*For the complex numbers $w$ and $z$.* $$|wz|=|w|\cdot|z| \text{ and } |\frac{w}{z}|=\frac{|w|}{|z|}$$$$\arg(wz) = \arg(w) + \arg(z) \text{ and } \arg(\frac{w}{z}) = \arg(w) - \arg(z)$$
Therefore, it is an exercise in matching numbers and playing around with it.
