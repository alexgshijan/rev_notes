*These are generally a number with both a real and imaginary component*

It is important to note that in a quadratic, every imaginary root has an imaginary conjugate. The imaginary conjugate $\bar{Z}$ of a complex number $Z$ switches the polarity of the imaginary component. *We can also utilise imaginary conjugates to rationalise the denominator.*
