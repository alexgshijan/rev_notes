*This is essentially a two dimensional grid where the y axis represents values in the imaginary plane and the x axis represents real values*

Argument $\theta$ - angle (in radians) of the vector on the Argand Diagram, represented as the smallest angle from the positive real axis.


*Trigonometric Form of Complex Numbers*
The modulus-­argument form of the complex number $z = x + iy$ is given by: $$z = r(\cos \theta + i\sin \theta)$$*where r is the modulus of z and θ is the argument.*

*Loci in Argand Diagrams*
Steps :
1. Substitute $x+yi$ as our complex numbers into the equation
2. Calculate the modulus using pythagorus, using values in terms of i as an axis
3. Square sides and rearrange in its simplest form - If there are $x^{2} \text{ and }y^{2}$ that don't cancel out, then we know that it's a circle. Otherwise it's a line.

*General Formula for Loci inequality.*$$arg(z-b)>\theta$$
Pay attention to the valid range of angles within the domain $-2\pi \to2\pi$ around the centre of the $b$ point.
