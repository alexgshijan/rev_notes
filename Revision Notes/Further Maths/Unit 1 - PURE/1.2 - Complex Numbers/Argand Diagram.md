*This is essentially a two dimensional grid where the y axis represents values in the imaginary plane and the x axis represents real values*

Argument $\theta$ - angle (in radians) of the vector on the Argand Diagram, represented as the smallest angle from the positive real axis.


*Trigonometric Form of Complex Numbers*
The modulus-­argument form of the complex number $z = x + iy$ is given by: $$z = r(\cos \theta + i\sin \theta)$$*where r is the modulus of z and θ is the argument.*
