**Formula for scalar product of the vectors $a$ and $b$**$$\cos\theta|a||b|=a\cdot b$$*if either sides are 0, then the vectors are likely perpendicular.*
Multiply the two vectors by sum of different dimension coefficients multiplied

**Vector Equation of the line $AB$ is:**$$r=OA+\lambda AB$$*where :*
- $OA$ is the vector to a point 
- $AB$ is the vector between two points, alternatively a parallel vector.
- $\lambda$ is a variable
