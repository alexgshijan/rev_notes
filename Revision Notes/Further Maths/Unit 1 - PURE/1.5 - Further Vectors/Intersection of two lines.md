*If two lines intersect, equating their equations will yield scalars $\lambda$ and $\micro$ that do not cause a contradiction.* In two dimensions, two non identical lines tat are not parallel will intersect. *Two lines lines that are neither parallel nor intersect each other are said to be skew*

*Our first step would be to check the direction to see if they're parallel. Otherwise let's assume that $r_{1}=r_{2}$ and compare coefficients to find values of $\lambda\text{ and }\micro$, finally find the point of intersection*
