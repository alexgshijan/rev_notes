*The shortest distance of a point $A$ to a plane is the distance $AP$ where $AP$ is a line perpendicular to the plane and $P$ is a point on the plane.*

**Formula for shortest distance from point to a plane  :**$$|\frac{\alpha n_{1}+\beta n_{2}+\gamma n_{2}+d}{\sqrt{n_{1}^{2}n_{2}^{2}n_{3}^{2}}}|$$
