*$n$ the normal is perpendicular to $AR$, therefore using the formula for scalar products we know that:* $$(r-a)\cdot n\therefore r\cdot n=a\cdot n\therefore\pmatrix{x\\y\\z}\cdot\pmatrix{n_{1}\\n_{2}\\n_{3}}=\pmatrix{a_{1}\\a_{2}\\a_{3}}\cdot\pmatrix{n_{1}\\n_{2}\\n_{3}}$$*We find the dot products and let $d=-a\cdot n$ :*$$n_{1}x+n_{2}y+n_{3}z=a\cdot n\therefore n_{1}x+n_{2}y+n_{3}z+d=0$$
**Angle between two planes**
*The angle between two planes are also equal to the angle between the normals. Therefore we just need to use the formula for scalar product of the two vectors*
