*This proof is for when you are trying to prove that a set of natural numbers are true as the value of $n$ in $P(n)$*

For this proof, we first check whether the statement is valid for $n = 1$, this is *the basis step*. 

We assume that the statement is true for all values of $n$ and we then attempt to prove that the statement is true for values $n + 1$, which would then allow us to directly prove the statement is true for all natural numbers. That was *the induction step*. It is important that we keep in mind what we are working towards, so noting it down at the bottom of our proof may prove useful
