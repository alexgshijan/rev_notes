*Matrices are a way of storing data in arrays. Adding or subtracting matrices of the same order, you compare each position and complete the function individually. Multiplying by a scalar quantity, you multiply each position by the quantity*

For matrices to multiply, the number of columns of the first matrix must equal the number of rows of the second matrix.  The new matrix will have the number of rows of the first matrix and the number of columns of the second matrix.
