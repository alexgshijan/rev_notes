*Matrices are a way of storing data in arrays. Adding or subtracting matrices of the same order, you compare each position and complete the function individually. Multiplying by a scalar quantity, you multiply each position by the quantity*

*Calc method for multiplication - `Math -> MAT/VCT -> Matrix Dimensions`*

The determinant of a matrix is important in a number of applications. The determinant of $\pmatrix{a&b\\c&d}=ad-bc$ *If there determinant is 0, then there is no way to undo the effects of it's transformation*

*Examples of matrix transformations where $(i, j)= \pmatrix{i_{1}&j_{1}\\i_{2}&j_{2}}$ :*
- $\pmatrix{-1&0\\0&-1}\to$  rotation of $180\degree$
- $\pmatrix{0&1\\1&0}\to$  reflection in $y=x$
- $\pmatrix{m&0\\0&m}\to$  enlargement by scale factor of $m$
- $\pmatrix{0&-1\\-1&0}\to$  reflection in $y=-x$
- $\pmatrix{\cos\theta&-\sin\theta\\\sin\theta&\cos\theta}\to$  anticlockwise rotation around origin by $\theta$
*For clockwise rotation you just take the negative and use the anticlockwise*

**Reflections on the line y=mx**
$$y=(\tan\theta )x:\pmatrix{\cos2\theta&\sin2\theta\\\sin2\theta&-\cos2\theta}$$
*We can equate the gradient $\tan\theta$ to a new gradient m, derive a value for theta and use that theta value for the transformation*

*The transformation A followed by B is equal to the transformation of $B\cdot A$*
