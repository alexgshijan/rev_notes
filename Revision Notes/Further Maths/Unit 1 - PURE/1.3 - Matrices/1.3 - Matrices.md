*Matrices are a way of storing data in arrays. Adding or subtracting matrices of the same order, you compare each position and complete the function individually. Multiplying by a scalar quantity, you multiply each position by the quantity*

The determinant of a matrix is important in a number of applications. The determinant of $\pmatrix{a&b\\c&d}=ad-bc$
*If there determinant is 0, then there is no way to undo the effects of it's transformation*
