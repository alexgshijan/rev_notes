**Discrete Random Variables**
The probability of each individual event is in between 0 and 1, as such we can derive ranges of solutions where an otherwise discrete value is not clear
$$\text{The Expected Value }E(x)=\mu=\sum\limits{}{x_{i}p_{i}}\text{ and Total Probability: }1=\sum\limits{}{p_{i}}$$
*where i represents each discrete result*

**[[Standard Deviation]]**
$$Var(x)=E(x^{2})-(E(x))^{2}\to\sigma=\sqrt{E(x^{2})-(E(x))^{2}\to\sigma}$$
