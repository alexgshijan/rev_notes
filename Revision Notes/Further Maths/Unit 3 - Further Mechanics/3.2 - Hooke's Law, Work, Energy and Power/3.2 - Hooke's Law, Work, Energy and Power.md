*This topic highly overlaps with [[1.5 - Solids under stress]]*

*We can rearrange Hooke's Law to form*$$T= \frac{\lambda x}{l}$$*Where :*
- T is tension
- Lambda is a constant
- x is extension
- l is the length of the spring

*Net work done on an object equals the object's change in kinetic energy - the work-energy principle*
$$\text{Work done}=Fx=\Delta KE$$
