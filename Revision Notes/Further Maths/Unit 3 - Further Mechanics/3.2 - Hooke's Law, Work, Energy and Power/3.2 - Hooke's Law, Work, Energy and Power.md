*This topic highly overlaps with [[1.5 - Solids under stress]] and [[4.9 - Forces and Newton's Laws - Friction]]*

*We can rearrange Hooke's Law to form*$$T= \frac{\lambda x}{l}$$*Where :*
- T is tension
- Lambda is a constant
- x is extension
- l is the length of the spring

*Net work done on an object equals the object's change in kinetic energy - the work-energy principle*
$$\text{Work done}=Fx=\Delta KE$$

*Power is the rate of work done*$$P=\frac{W}{t}=Fv$$*where :*
- P is power in units watts
- W is work in Joules
- F is force
- v is velocity

*Elastic Potential Energy*
The Elastic Potential Energy stored in a string or spring with extension (or compression) $x$m given by $$E.P.E.=\frac{\lambda x^{2}}{2l}$$
