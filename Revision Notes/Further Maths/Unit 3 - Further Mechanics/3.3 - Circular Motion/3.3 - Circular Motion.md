*Refer to [[3.1 - Circular Motion]]*

**Using energy considerations for a vertical circle**
By considering the Kinetic Energy at the lowest point and Kinetic and Gravitational Potential Energy at other points, we can find velocities at other points and then use $F=m\frac{v^{2}}{r}$ 

**Conditions for a particle to complete full vertical circle**
*Case One : Particle on a string*
- String must be taut at maximum height (Tension > 0)
*Case Two : Particle on a rod*
- Particle must be in motion at maximum height (Velocity > 0)
*Case Three : Particle on a ring*
- Particle must be in motion at maximum height (Velocity > 0)
*Case Four : Particle on inner surface*
- Reaction force must be greater than 0

**Rolling particle on a circle**
- By using variable $r\theta m$ we can calculate a angle at which the reaction force exerted on the particle is 0, that is to say the angle at which the particle looses contact with the circle. This angle is 48.2Ëš in perfect physics world.
