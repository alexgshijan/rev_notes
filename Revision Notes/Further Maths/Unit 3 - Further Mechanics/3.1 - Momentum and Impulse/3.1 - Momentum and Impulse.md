**Formula :**$$p=m\cdot v\to I=\Delta mv=mv-mu=Ft$$*where :*
- p is momentum in units $kgms^{-1}$
- I is impulse in units $Ns$
It is important to note that both $kgms^{-1}$ and $Ns$ are identical

*When two objects collide, the total momentum of the objects is the same before and after the collision*$$\Sigma (m_{n}u_{n})=\Sigma(m_{n}v_{n})$$*where n signify the different objects*
