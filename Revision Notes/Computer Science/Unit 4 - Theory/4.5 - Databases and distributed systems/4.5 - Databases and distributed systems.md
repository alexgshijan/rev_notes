*Refer to [[1.7 - Database Systems]]*

*Normalisation - This is a formal, methodical process to design data tables optimally and reduce data redundancy and lower the chance of data inconsistency*

1st normal form (1NF) : *If there are no repeating groups.*
2nd normal form (2NF) : *1NF and all the non-key attributes depend entirely upon the primary key.*
3rd normal form (3NF) : *2NF and each table has no non-key attributes that depend upon other non-key attributes.*

**Distributed Systems**
*Positives :*
- Data sharing – allows access to a common database
- Resource/service sharing – printers etc. 
- Communication 
- Spread workload over multiple machines 
- Easily scalable
*Negatives :*
- Software for distributed systems can be harder to develop 
- Network disadvantages apply
- Must result in a performance gain or it becomes obsolete

**Distributed Databases**
*Positives :*
- Data which is only needed in one physical location (an office of a large company for example) can be stored locally to improve access speeds, efficiency and performance. 
- If a site requires the records from another site, they can request for them to be transferred to allow for quicker access
- Resilient. A problem in one site will not stop other sites from working, and a problem with one computer won’t stop the others working
- Security. Staff access can be limited to only their portion of the database. Also, data doesn’t necessarily need to be transferred across the internet, so less of a security risk in data transfer
- Network traffic is reduced so less bandwidth costs 
- A single site database still works even if the connection between sites in temporarily broken 
- Scaling: if demand increases it is straight forward to add an extra node to the distributed database (A large company, the demand will likely increase/decrease when a market changes and the system can be scaled quickly) 
- High performance: Queries and updates are largely local so there is no network bottleneck, and processing is shared across multiple computers
*Negatives :*
- It can be difficult to maintain integrity & consistency and ensure all computers are up-to date 
- It is far more complicated to manage than a centralised database, requiring the specialised DDBMS which may be more expensive
