*Low Level*
- Little to no abstraction (difference) between the language and machine code (binary)
- Machine code doesn’t require a compiler or interpreter
- deal for fast execution speed (e.g. boot strap loader)
- More efficient than high level language programs
- Requires less time to translate to machine code
- Usually executable programs are smaller
*High Level*
- More abstraction between the language and machine code 
- Does require a compiler or interpreter 
- Can be procedural, event driven, visual or object oriented
- Easier to understand, commands are more like English 
- Identifiers can be long and meaningful 
- Allow powerful commands to perform complex tasks 
- Allows for creation of reusable modules
