*As well as [[Levels of Languages]], we can categorise languages by types as well, which are known are “paradigms”*

*Procedural or imperative*
Written as a sequence of instructions which is performed in turn, with the programmer deciding the order. Uses sequence, selection, iteration. Heavily relies on functions and procedures

*Event-driven*
Some programs require a large amount of user interaction. When a user does something, a function will run to process that action. The program sits in a loop waiting for user interaction. Functions are known as “listeners” or “callbacks”. Unlike procedural, these don’t run one after the other. Used heavily in GUIs, games and apps
