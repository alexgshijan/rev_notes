Data security is the practice of protecting digital information from unauthorised access, corruption, or theft throughout its entire lifecycle.

The term 'integrity' means guarding against improper information modification or destruction, and includes ensuring information non-repudiation and authenticity.

*Risks*
- Outside access and manipulation of files
- Unauthorised reading or copying of files
- Corruption of File
- Loss or deliberate deletion of files
- Different versions of files used causing integrity problems

*Contingency Plans* - to be enacted if a disaster were to occur and cause massive data loss

The contingency plan must consider 
- What data is stored 
- How each part of the business interconnects
- How each area would be impacted in the event of a disaster and identify key risks

The plan would need to be tested and maintained. If the business were to change in some way, the plan would need to be updated

The main three steps in recovery that should be considered in every contingency plan are:
- Replacing hardware
- Reinstalling software
- Reinstating backups
