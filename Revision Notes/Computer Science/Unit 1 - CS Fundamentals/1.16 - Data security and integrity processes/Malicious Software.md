**Distribution**
*Virus*
- Self replicating malicious software which will deliver a “payload” which will affect the workings of the PC. Propagates using a code file as the attack vector. 
- Spreads across a network through self-writing code, identifying routes to attach itself to the network as quick as possible.
*Worm*
- A worm is the same as a virus – but can travel on its own. No need for a host program/vector, it won’t stop on its own until it cannot propagate through a network anymore.
*Trojan*
- Trojans are designed to mislead users with their intent. The payload is hidden behind a ‘safe’ program.
- They do not replicate themselves.
- Usually will leave a backdoor route into the computer (think Botnets)

**Payload**
*Spyware*
- Key presses are tracked and data is typically sent back to the hacker through the Internet – unless the attack is happening within the company!
- Used for identity fraud, user access – essentially gathering data!
*Ransomware*
- Scare-ware scares the user by threatening to infect their computer or even pretending that the computers are already infected
- Ransomware deletes/encrypts files and can force users to pay to return the files. However, sometimes threat actors will just take the money, or won’t even give the user the chance!
*Remote Access Software*
- Computers infected with this can become “bots” – PCs that a hacker can control to perform an action. Groups of these bots are known as “botnets”
- The hacker can directly control all of these PCs to perform certain actions
- Often used for Distributed Denial of Service (DDos) attacks, spam email campaigns, click fraud
