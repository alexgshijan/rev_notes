*As well as [[Levels of Languages]], we can categorise languages by types as well, which are known are “paradigms”*

*Procedural or imperative*
Written as a sequence of instructions which is performed in turn, with the programmer deciding the order. Uses sequence, selection, iteration. Heavily relies on functions and procedures

*Event-driven*
Some programs require a large amount of user interaction. When a user does something, a function will run to process that action. The program sits in a loop waiting for user interaction. Functions are known as “listeners” or “callbacks”. Unlike procedural, these don’t run one after the other. Used heavily in GUIs, games and apps

*Visual*
Ideal place to start learning programming for children, using drag and drop rather than learning syntax and useful for creating a GUI. Useful for creating a GUI but not useful for larger or advanced programs

*Markup*
Not a paradigm in the same way as the others, but very prevalent in web technology and you need to know about them! Could sort of be considered declarative. Use commands known as “mark-ups” to give text meaning. The text has instructions associated which are interpreted and determine how things are displayed

*Declarative*
These are suited to artificial intelligence applications or expert systems. The program works by you giving it a goal, then it works out whether or not the goal can be achieved
