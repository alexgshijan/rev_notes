An operating system is the software that manages the computer. It can :
- manage the resources of the system 
- manage programs installed and being run 
- manage the security of the system
- manage the backing store of the system
- provide an interface between the user and the computer.

**Startup sequence :**
- The BIOS appears
- The main boot device will be checked for an Operating system 
- The main part of the OS is then loaded into RAM.  This part of the OS is responsible for process management, hardware management and other key low-level tasks, and is known as the **kernel**. 
- Once this has been loaded, the user interface part of the OS is loaded alongside key utility software.

**Interrupts :**
Both hardware and software can trigger interrupts and these are then dealt with by calling an interrupt service routine (ISR). The CPU has to stop whatever it is doing and deal with the interrupt. Different interrupts will have different priorities, and the OS manages this too.

**There are a variety of different types of OS available, each with different uses, attributes and modes of operation**

*Single-user OS*
Single-user OSs are very common, with Windows being a classic example. Although Windows can allow multiple users on a PC, only one of those users can be active at once. 
This is what you are used to using and what you will probably associate with the way an OS works
*Multi-user OS & networked OS*
Similar to school system

*Batch systems* and *Real-time systems* are more niche
