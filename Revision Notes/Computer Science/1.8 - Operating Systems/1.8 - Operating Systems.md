An operating system is the software that manages the computer. It can :
- manage the resources of the system

- provide an interface between the user and the computer.

**Utility Software :**
A utility is a relatively small program provided by the operating system that has one purpose, usually concerned with the maintenance of the system.

*Anti-virus & firewall programs:* Viruses are malicious programs, often designed to harm a computer system in some way and spread to others. Anti-virus software detects, quarantines and removes viruses. Firewalls monitor network traffic and can automatically block connections. 

*Disk defragmentation:* Disk defragmentation utilities ensure that files are stored together in one place rather than in parts scattered across the hard drive. This helps stop the computer slowing down.

*Compression:* Compression programs reduce the amount of space data takes up in storage. 

*File managers*: Allow files and directories to be moved, copied, deleted and renamed. 

*Backup:* Allow back-ups to be automatically made regularly of specified data.
