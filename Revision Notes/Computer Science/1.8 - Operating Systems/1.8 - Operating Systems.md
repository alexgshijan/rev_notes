An operating system is the software that manages the computer. It can :
- manage the resources of the system 
- manage programs installed and being run 
- manage the security of the system
- manage the backing store of the system
- provide an interface between the user and the computer.

**Startup sequence :**
- The BIOS appears
- The main boot device will be checked for an Operating system 
- The main part of the OS is then loaded into RAM.  This part of the OS is responsible for process management, hardware management and other key low-level tasks, and is known as the **kernel**. 
- Once this has been loaded, the user interface part of the OS is loaded alongside key utility software.
