*Systems life cycle – problem definition*
Is there a problem with the current system, or are there problems that an entirely new system could solve?
The customer might think they know what they want, but chances are this is quite vague. The systems analyst needs to clearly establish what the problems are and what they new system could do to solve them.
At this stage, the *scope* of the problem will be laid out. This will say exactly what the new system should do when complete, and how it will solve the perceived problems of the customer.

*Feasibility Study*
Economic:
- The project will have a limited budget
- Costs such as maintenance, salaries, hardware and software
- Profit turnover
Time:
- Can the project realistically be done on time?
- What different factors need to be taken into consideration at this stage?
Technical:
- Are the resources available sufficient for completing the project? 
- Are the developers who work for the company taking on the project skilled in the necessary areas?
Political:
- What is the proposed project includes aspects that are politically sensitive? 
- For example, any system relating to the NHS, prison service, HMRC, animal testing, or self driving cars could lead to divisive opinion and bad publicity if things go wrong
Legal:
- New systems must comply with the laws of the country or countries it will be released in
- This starts with data protection laws but can include a whole host of different legislation depending on what the system is for

*Investigation and Analysis*
Observation
- Analyst shadowing employees to make notes on how they do their job in their natural environment to see how the business works.
Questionaire
- Allows analyst to get a large quantity of data from lots of employees. 
- Faster than observing or interviewing every single employee at a company if it’s a big organisation
Interview 
- Good place to start with analysis – typically done with a few of the key stakeholders. Allows for collection of detailed, accurate information
Document Collection 
- Gathering of business related documents such as invoices, orders, financial records, memos
- Good way to examine the sorts of data the new system will handle
