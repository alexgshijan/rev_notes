Data structures are specially allocated areas of computer memory that are arranged or organised in a particular way. Their purpose is to store multiple items of *related* data

*Sorting & Searching*
If data is properly organised then it can be sorted and searched quickly and easily. Some search algorithms can only work if data is in order

*Use of Space*
Data should be stored in an efficient manner so that it does not take up more space than necessary

*Manipulation*
Programmers need to be able to access data, save it, update it, link it to other pieces of data, and analyse it. Data structures help them do this

There is a degree of overlap with [[1.7 - Database Systems]]

| **Scenario** | **Data structure** | **Reason** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| A librarian storing data about library books | Record | Multiple data types needed, storing related information about a single entity |
| A  teacher storing test results for a class of 20 pupils | 2D array | Single data type needed, storing multiple items of information |
| An online shop storing data about the items they are selling | Record | Multiple data types needed, storing related information about a single entity |
| An individual keeping track of their times on a 5K run over a number of weeks | 1D array | Single data type needed, storing multiple items of information |

**Validation**
*Lookup* - Select from a number of set options
*Type* -  Checking that the appropriate data type has been used
*Format* -  Is the data in a particular format (e.g. car registration LL00 LLL)
*Range* -  Are the numbers within lower and upper limits
*Length* -  Is the data in the field not longer than a given value
*Presence* -  Has anything been entered?
