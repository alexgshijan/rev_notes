*The layout of a packet is split into header, data and footer*

Packets are small pieces of a larger file or item of data 
Packets are typically 1-1.5KB big, although they can be up to 64KB in size, depending on which protocols are being used
Packets also have headers and footers which contain vital information about the packet. The protocols that are employed during the transmission of data adds information to the packet’s header and footer

These packets include : 

|**TCP/IP Packet Contents**|

|Order number (for re-assembly)| 
|The actual data|
|Error control (checksum) bit|
|Control signals|
