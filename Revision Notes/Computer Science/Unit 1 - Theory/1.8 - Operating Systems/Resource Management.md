*Backing store*
- Ensuring that data is stored and can be retrieved correctly from any disk drive
- Maintaining a filing system and organising files in a hierarchical directory structure
- It also controls attributes on files
*I/O devices :*
- Communicating with and receiving data input from a keyboard, mouse etc.
- Communicating with and sending data to a printer, monitor etc.
*RAM :*
- Ensuring all programs and data, including itself, are stored in correct memory locations.
- Ensuring all programs and data have enough memory allocated.
- Utilising virtual memory when there is not enough memory available to run a program.
*Processers :*
- Ensuring that different processes can utilise the CPU and do not interfere with each other or crash.
- Ensuring that all tasks appear to run simultaneously on a multi-tasking OS…
- … when in reality the CPU is constantly switching between tasks.
*Other Hardware :*
- Anything else connected to the motherboard such as a graphics card or sound card needs to communicate with the other components 
- This is achieved using device drivers – small programs managed by the OS which act as a go-between
