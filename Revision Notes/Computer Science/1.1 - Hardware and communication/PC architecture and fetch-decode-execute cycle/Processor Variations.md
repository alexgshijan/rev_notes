**CISC** – complex instruction set computer
**RISC** – reduced instruction set computer

A 32 bit system architecture can transfer 32 bits along its buses and hold 32 bits within its registers at any one time, 

32 bit systems can access a maximum of 4GB of memory, while 64 bit systems can access 16EB (exabytes, so 16 billion GB) of memory, this is because a processor with a larger [[Computer Science/1.1 - Hardware and communication/Topic Keywords|world length]] is able to have larger RAM slot addresses and so is able to access magnitudes more amounts of data
