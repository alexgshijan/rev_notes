**Fragmentation is the word used to describe the way data is split up and stored at different physical locations on a disk**
That is, the data that makes up a single file might be split up and stored in several different parts of the hard drive
Operating systems can run a defragmentation program which will re-arrange the file parts on a disc into the order required for access 
This will improve the speed of access because the disk head does not have to travel as far

*However this doesn't work for SSDs*
- SSDs actually have quite a limited lifespan. Every time they are written to, their lifespan decreases marginally 
- The defragmentation process is basically a lot of small read/write operations, so it is not the best idea to perform a defrag on an SSD as this will contribute to limiting its life expectancy
