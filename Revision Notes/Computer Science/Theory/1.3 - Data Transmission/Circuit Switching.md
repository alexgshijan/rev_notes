With circuit switching a dedicated route is used for the duration of the communication between two devices. This route cannot be used by any other traffic during this communication period. All packets will arrive in the order they are sent so there is no need for any re-assembly

An example of this would be old fashioned telephone lines, or more a relevant example would be two computers connected with a cable.
