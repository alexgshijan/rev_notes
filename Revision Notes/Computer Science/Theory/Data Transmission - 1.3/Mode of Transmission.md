Parallel Transmission :
- **All of the bits in a byte are sent along several wires simultaneously.** The cable that connects these transmissions consists of many wires (usually multiples of 8 or 16… why?) 
- This is generally used over short distances. This is because it is difficult to keep voltages on the eight wires in line with each other after a certain distance. This problem is known as **skewing**.

Serial Transmission :
- **Serial data transmission is when single bits are sent one after the other along a single wire**
- Examples of where this is used include under sea cable and telephone wires 
- Serial transmission is used in long-distance communication because the signal going along a single pathway is not susceptible to skew
