**This process involves taking several data streams and combining them to send them across a single wire (mux)** When the data reaches it’s destination, the single stream is split back up into the original separate streams (demux)
*You can also reverse this process – this is known as inverse multiplexing*

It could save on costs, with less wires/cables needing to be installed 
Good for linking serial and parallel transmissions 
It could also increase transfer speeds in some circumstances

**Examples :**
- Telephone calls, where multiple calls between different people in an area are combined and sent across a network
- Television/radio broadcasts, where multiple different stations' output signals can be combined in order to be transmitted across the country, then split up into the different channels at the destination
