- Convert the real number such as 26.375 to a 10 bit fixed point binary  011010.0110 
- ‘Float’ the binary point to _between the leftmost 0 and 1_ – this is called [[Normalising]]  and gives us 0.110100110 as a mantissa
- Count how many times the binary point was moved (5 in this case), and whether it was moved left (positive) or right (negative) – this gives us a denary exponent of 5
- Convert this exponent to binary, 000101 in our case 
- Our mantissa is 0.110100110 and the exponent is 000101 
- Our final floating point number is 0110100110 000101
