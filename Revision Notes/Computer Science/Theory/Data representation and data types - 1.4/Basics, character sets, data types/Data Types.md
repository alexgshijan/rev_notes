Some examples of data types include **Integers, Floats, Characters, String and Boolean**

**Integer :**
Depends on how big the number is, and whether the integer is unsigned or representing negative numbers as well
8 bits can store 0 to 255 unsigned, or -128 to +127 signed
In many programming languages you get “short” and “long” integers
Short is 2 bytes, 0 to 65,565 unsigned or -32,768 to 32,767 signed  
Long is 4 bytes, 0 to 4,294,967,295 unsigned or -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 signed

**Real/ Float :**
Depends on how precise the number is (how many decimal places)
Can be single or double precision, single is usually 4 bytes, double usually 8

**Character :**
Depends on the character set used
*Extended ASCII requires 1 byte, while Unicode could require 2/4 bytes*

**String :**
if computer uses ASCII character set, 1 byte per character in the string 
You need to decide how much space you need based on what the string is

**Boolean :**
The answer should be 1 bit as it’s just 0 or 1 for false or true, but in reality it depends on the system or programming language
