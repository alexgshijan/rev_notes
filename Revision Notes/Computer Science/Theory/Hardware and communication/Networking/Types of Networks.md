START
**Client-server network**
- In this configuration, a server has a number of connected clients which keeps track of by having a database of users who can log into the network 
- The server is high end and powerful. Everything that happens on the network goes through the server 
- The server provides services to the clients such as print, web, email, data processing and storage 
- Clients can sometimes be known as “thin clients” and hold nothing/very little locally. Chromebooks are good examples of this

**Peer-to-peer network**
- All computers in this configuration are of equal status (hence the use of the word peer)
- Computers can act as client or server, or both. 
- Each PC can communicate with all of the others 
- Each may have a role in managing the network, such as file storage or dealing with peripherals
- Far simpler and potentially cheaper to set up than server-client and typically used in small networks of 10 PCs or less. 
- The drawbacks are that they do not have the powerful features of a client-server system and that the security of the network is not controlled centrally and must be set up on each PC individually.
