**Encryption :** Scrambling data using a key or algorithm to ensure that it can’t be understood by anyone other than intended receiver.

**Symmetric Encryption :**
- One method of encryption is to use an encryption key (another bit pattern) and the XOR logic gate. We can then send our encrypted data and the key (usually separately), and when the receiver gets it they apply XOR and the key to the encrypted data to retrieve the original number
- As you can imagine, this isn’t a particularly secure method of encrypting data and wouldn’t be too difficult to decrypt, but it demonstrates the basic principles
