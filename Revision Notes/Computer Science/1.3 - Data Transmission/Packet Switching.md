With this type of switching, packets take independent routes across a network. This is much more secure – if one or two packets are “sniffed” by a hacker, they will only have an incomplete version of the whole file. This also means if one route is unavailable there are plenty of other routes to travel along

If packets were lost, then the TCP Protocol will ensure the packet is resent. Then finally the TCP Protocol ensures the file is reassembled correctly
