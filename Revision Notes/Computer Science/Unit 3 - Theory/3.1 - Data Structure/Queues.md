*Queues work on a First In First Out basis*

Enqueuing – adding a new elements to the back of the queue
Dequeuing – removing the element at the front of the queue

*Implementation*
Linked list – add the new node to the bottom of the list, and remove nodes from the top. Use pointers to track the front and back. This is known as a linear queue. 
Array/list (Python) – can either be linear or circular. These queues have a **set size**.
