*A data structure is an area of memory that can hold multiple data values. Data structures help organise related data in a particular format, and allow manipulation operations such as sorting, searching, adding or removing.*

Data structures can be either static (the size of the structure wonâ€™t change during the program runtime) or dynamic (the size could change during runtime)

*Dynamic structures are harder to program and less predictable, but they allow greater flexibility to the programmer.*

*Static structures are easier to setup and more or less look after themselves, but issues can arise when more memory is needed but not available.*
