*This is a WJEC A Level Revision Notes Website for Maths, (tbc. Further Maths), Physics and Computer Science, all typed up by me, Alex Shijan. As of right now, all AS notes have been completed (plus Unit 3 and Unit 4 of Maths.).* 

To get started, navigate to the file tree on the left :)

*For a slightly more up to date, text only version, visit the* [Github Repo](https://github.com/alexgshijan/rev_notes/tree/main/Revision%20Notes) 
*Anki cards are available on request from my* [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/c/ca30d02b84).
*To list your ad on this website, for 1-to-1 tutoring or for any other enquires, contact me [here](mailto:alexgshijan@gmail.com)*

Another really useful resource for revision would be [the WJEC student resources website](https://www.wjec.co.uk/home/student-support/revision/revision-resources/). Most subjects have their dedicated online lessons which I've personally found immensely helpful.
