**Disproof by counter example**
This is the easiest type of proof, all we have to do is find a single case where the statement is false

**Proof by deduction**
This is the 'best' type of proof as we can use algebra to prove the statement for all possible values

**Proof by exhaustion**
This proof requires us to see whether the statement is true for each and every number. This is the least efficient type of proof when working with large ranges of numbers but is more plausible when working with a limited set*
