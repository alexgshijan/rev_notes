*Normal Distribution curves generally look like a bell curve*

**$X$ modelled with the distribution $N(\micro,\sigma^{2})$**

*Where :*
- Mean is represented as $\micro$
- [[Standard Deviation]] is represented as $\sigma$ 
- The data is continuous 
- The area under the graph is 1

*The curve has points of inflection one standard deviation from the mean*

**Calc Method**
- Use the `Distribution` submenu
- Since this method uses continuous data, there is no need to change numbers between 'greater than' and 'greater than or equal to'

*You're not required to use the formula for this.*
