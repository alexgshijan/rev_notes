**$X$ modelled with the distribution $B(n,p)$ :**$$P(X=r)=(^{n}_r)p^{r}(1-p)^{n-r}$$*Where :*
- there are a fixed number of trials, $n$
- there are two possible outcomes: ‘success’ and ‘failure’
- there is a fixed probability of success, $p$
- the trials are independent of each other

**Calc Method**
- Use the `Distribution` submenu
- Since this method uses discrete data, you need to factor in the 'equal to' part of the signs.

**Table Method**
- If the success probability is greater than 0.5, use the failure probability instead and calculate using the failures.
- If using the inequality signs, sum up the relevant values

**Expected Value**
- $np$ is the expected value as binomial distribution peaks at the middle

**[[Standard Deviation]]**
- $np(1-p)$
