**Formula to remember :**
$P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)$

**Note : $\Sigma P = 1$

**If two events are independent then whether one event happens does not affect the probability of the other happening.**
If A and В are independent then:
- ﻿﻿P(A and B) = P(A)× P(B)

**If two events are mutually exclusive they can't happen at the same time.**
If A and B are mutually exclusive then:
- ﻿﻿P(A and B) = 0
- ﻿﻿P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)
