|Random Sampling|Simple Random Sampling |**What is it :** Every sample has an equal chance of being selected.<br>**Method :** In sampling frame each item has identifying number. Use random number generator, or ‘lottery sampling’ (names in a hat). | Bias free. Easy and cheap to implement. Each number has a known equal chance of being selected.| Not suitable when population size is large. Sampling frame needed.|
|Random Sampling|Systematic Sampling  |**What is it :** Required elements are chosen at regular intervals in ordered list. i.e. Take every kth elements where: $k=\frac{population size}{sample size}$ starting at random item between 1 and k. |Simple and quick to use. Suitable for large samples/ populations. | Sampling frame again needed. Can introduce bias if sampling frame not random.|
