For finding the gradient of the coords $(a, b)$ and $(x, y)$, use the following formula:
**Gradient** $= \frac{b-y}{a-x}$ 
This formula can also be represented as $\frac{Δy}{Δx}$
Note the order of the coordinates (first then second coord) remains this same, this is essential

For finding the midpoint of the coords $(a, b)$ and $(x, y)$, use the following formula:
**Midpoint** $= (\frac{a+x}{2},\frac{b+y}{2})$ 

For finding unknowns :
**Arrange known values in the format $y=mx+c$**
If you know one set of coordinates on the line and are trying to figure out the other set of coordinates, first sub in the known coordinates into $y=mx+c$, then figure out $m$ and $c$, then finally replace the coordinates from the unknown.

**Parallel Lines :** The Gradients of the lines are equal
**Perpendicular Lines :** The product of the gradients of the lines are equal to -1
	They also meet up to make a right-angle
	You can find a perpendicular line's gradient by dividing -1 by the gradient

**Distance between two points :** Between the two coordinates $(x,y)$ and $(a,b)$, we can calculate the distance using : $\sqrt{(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2}$
