*This measures both the variance from the 'trend' and the polarity of the relationship, this value can be between -1 and 1*

We conduct [[2.5 - Hypothesis Testing]]  to see the probability the data is random - has a correlation coefficient of 0.

*Using our chosen significance level, we find the critical value on the PMCC table, if our correlation coefficient is larger than the PMCC critical value, then we have evidence to reject $H_{0}:p=0$*
