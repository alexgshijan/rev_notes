*Understand that each material has a friction coefficient, represented as $\micro$, given a value between 0 and 1. For a material to be moved, it's pushing force must be greater than the reactionary friction force. Items with higher mass also result in a greater frictional force*

When pushing on an object, *the frictional force must be overcome* before the object accelerates. This can represented with the formula :
$$F\leq\micro R$$
At the moment that the *pushing force is equal to the frictional force*, we observe :
$$F=\micro R$$
And finally when the *pushing force overcomes the frictional force*, we denote :
$$F>\micro R$$
*We can calculate this value of $\micro R$ by observing the minimum required force to move the object and using that as an approximate value.*

**Note : Always 'collate' forces into an resultant force before using for calculations.**

As we know, items at standstill are harder to push than objects that are moving, to reflect this objects initially you have to have a pushing force greater than $\micro R$ but after passing that point, the pushing force can fall equal to $\micro R$
