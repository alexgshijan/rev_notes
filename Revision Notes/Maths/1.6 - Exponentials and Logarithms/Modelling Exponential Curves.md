Use logarithmic graphs to estimate parameters in relationships of
the form y = axn and y = kbx , given data for x and y.
Link to laws of logarithms.
Understand that on a graph of log y against log x, the gradient is n
and the intercept is log a, and that on a graph of log y against x,
the gradient is log b and the intercept is log k.
Understand and use exponential growth and decay; use in
modelling (examples may include the use of e in continuous
compound interest, radioactive decay, drug concentration decay,
exponential growth as model for population growth.)
Consideration of limitations and refinements of exponential models.
The formal differentiation and integration of formulae involving ex
and/or ax will not be required
