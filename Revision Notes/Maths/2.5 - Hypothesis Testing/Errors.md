**It's important to note that [[2.5 - Hypothesis Testing]] doesn't prove anything - we are simply considering if there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis**

A hypothesis test may give you the "wrong result":
- Type 1 Error : Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is in fact true
- Type 2 Error : Accepting the null hypothesis when it is in fact false

*Calculating Type 1 & 2 Errors :*
Increasing the significance level will increase the chance for a *Type 2 Error*
Decreasing the significance level will increase the chance for a *Type 1 Error*

The probability of a Type 1 error is equal to the significance level, or rather it's the *probability of the critical regions*
It is possible to work out the probability of a Type 2 error, but only if you know the actual value of the parameter probability. *We use the critical regions of the original test to form a range of values that would be considered valid under the old probability and do a binomial with the new probability*
