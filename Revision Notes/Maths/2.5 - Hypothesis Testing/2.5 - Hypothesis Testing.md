**One Tail - Format :**
$p =$ *probability of success*
$H_0$ : $p=p_1$ *where $p_1$ is the unbiased success rate*
$H_1$ : $p >/< p_1$ *this would be the bias, so p falls towards suspected bias*

1 Tail *Only considering one side of the distribution graph*
Significance level of 5% *This is the standard cut off point*

Let $X = x$ *where x is the number of 'bias' throws in $n$*

*If $X$~B$(n,p)$ > the significance level, then we don't have conclusive evidence of bias. It would be insufficient evidence to reject $H_0$ and also insufficient evidence to accept $H_1$*

**Critical Regions :**
- This is where we find the point at which the probability falls below the significance level *we denote the first value to pass it*
- Using two tails, we need to reference critical regions on both tails

**Two Tail - Method Changes**
$p =$ *probability of success*
$H_0$ : $p=p_1$*
$H_1$ : $p \neq p_1$

2 Tail *Considering both side of the distribution graph*
Significance level of 5% *Since it's two tail, we half the significance level on each tail*

Let $X = x$ *where x is the number of 'bias' throws in $n$*

*We model values to find the critical regions on both sides of the graph*
