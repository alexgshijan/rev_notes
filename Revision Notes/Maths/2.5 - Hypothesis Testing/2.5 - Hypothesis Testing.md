**Format :**
$p =$ *probability of success*
$H_0$ : $p=p_1$ *where $p_1$ is the unbiased success rate*
$H_1$ : $p >/< p_1$ *this would be the bias, so p falls towards suspected bias*

Significance level of 5% *This is the standard cut off point*

Let $X = x$ *where x is the number of 'bias' throws in $n$*

*If $X$~B$(n,p)$ > the significance level, then we don't have conclusive evidence of bias. It would be insufficient evidence to reject $H_0$ and also insufficient evidence to accept $H_1$*
