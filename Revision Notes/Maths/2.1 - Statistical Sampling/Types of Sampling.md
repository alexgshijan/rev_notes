| Random Sampling     | Simple Random Sampling | **What is it :** Every sample has an equal chance of being selected.<br>**Method :** In sampling frame each item has identifying number. Use random number generator, or ‘lottery sampling’ (names in a hat).          | Bias free. Easy and cheap to implement. Each number has a known equal chance of being selected. | Not suitable when population size is large. Sampling frame needed.                      |
| Random Sampling     | Systematic Sampling    | **What is it :** Required elements are chosen at regular intervals in ordered list. i.e. Take every kth elements where: $k=\frac{\text{population size}}{\text{sample size}}$ starting at random item between 1 and k. | Simple and quick to use. Suitable for large samples/ populations.                               | Sampling frame again needed. Can introduce bias if sampling frame not random.           |
| Non-Random Sampling | Opportunity Sampling   | Sample taken from people who are available at time of study, who meet criteria.                                                                                                                                        | Easy to carry out. Inexpensive.                                                                 | Unlikely to provide a representative sample. Highly dependent on individual researcher. |
