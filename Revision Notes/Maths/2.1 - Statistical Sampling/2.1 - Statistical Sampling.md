|Name | Method | Considers [[Skew]] |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Mean | Sum values divided by number of values | Yes |
|Median | Middle point value | No|
|Mode | Most common value | Yes |
|Mid-range | Half the range plus the minimum value| Yes|
*Mean is considered the best average since it considers every single value*

**Line of regression :**
- In context, as *x name* increases 1 unit, *y name* increases by *gradient* units

**Finding Median & Quartiles of Listed Data - Calculator Method :**
- Enter the values as list 1 on the statistics submenu
- Hit Calc and 1-Var
- After checking that $n$ does in fact equal the number of values entered into the list and that $\Sigma x$ is equal to the sum of all values entered, scroll down to get the needed values
