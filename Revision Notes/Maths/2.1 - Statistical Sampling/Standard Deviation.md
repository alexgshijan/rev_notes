**Variance is a measure of spread that takes all values into account.**
*It is the average squared distance from the mean.*

**Formula for Variation:**$$\sigma^{2} = \frac{\Sigma(x-\bar{x})^{2}}{n}=\frac{\Sigma (x^{2})}{n}-\bar{x}^{2}$$
*Where :*
- Variance = $\sigma^{2}$ 
- Mean = $\bar{x}$
- Number of values in the data = $n$

*Note : $\Sigma (x^{2})$ represent the sum of all (data points squared)*

**Formula for Standard Deviation :** 
- *Where Variance = $\sigma^{2}$, Standard deviation is = $\sigma$*


**Calculator Method :**
- On Calc set `1Var XList` as the list with range-average
- set `1Var Freq` as the frequency of data points for each range
