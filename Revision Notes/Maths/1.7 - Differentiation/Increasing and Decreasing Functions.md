*An increasing function has a gradient equal to or greater than 0*
*A decreasing function has a gradient equal to or less than 0*

A function can also be increasing and decreasing in certain intervals

To find where a function is decreasing or increasing, we first [[Differentiation from first principles|Differentiate]] then factorise the gradient to find the ranges of x at which the gradient is negative/ positive.
