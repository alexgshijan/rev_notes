**Formula :**
$$\int u\frac{dv}{dx}\text{ dx}=uv-\int v\frac{du}{dx}\text{ dx}$$
*where :*
$u$ and $\frac{dv}{dx}$ are two parts of the original question. We need to choose to choose our $u$ and $\frac{dv}{dx}$ cleverly. There are also certain cases where we may need to recursively use this function.
