**First Law :**
Every Object continues in a state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless acted on by a resultant force

**Second Law :**
Resultant force = Mass $\cdot$ acceleration

**Third Law :**
When one object exerts a force on another, there is always a reaction which is equal and opposite in direction to the acting force

**Note :**
When modelling these laws, we primarily use *N2L* to work out the acceleration of a particle. It is important to assess the *Resultant Force* when working with particles with many parts. An important aspect we need to consider is *Tension*

$g$ is assumed to equal 9.8 unless stated otherwise
