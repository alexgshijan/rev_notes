![[Discrete Uniform Distribution]]

*Continuous Uniform Distribution* - $X$~$U[a,b]$
In this model, a total probability of 1 is split between the specified interval. Compared to discrete, decimal values are possible - *special considerations must be taken with bounds*. 
$$\text{Mean }=E(x)=\frac{1}{2}(a+b)$$
$$\text{Variance }=Var(x)=\frac{1}{12}(b-a)^{2}$$
