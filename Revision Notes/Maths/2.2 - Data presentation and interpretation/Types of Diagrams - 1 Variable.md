**Pie Charts :**
- Can be used to show percentage or proportional data
- Should only be used for six categories or fewer
- Can be used to compare distributions however caution must be noted if you don't know the totals

**Histograms :**
- Area is the frequency

**Box and Whisker :**
- This clearly displays the [[2.1 - Statistical Sampling|quartiles]]
- If any values fall outside the outlier limits, we need to draw a whisker for the limit and draw a cross for the outlier
