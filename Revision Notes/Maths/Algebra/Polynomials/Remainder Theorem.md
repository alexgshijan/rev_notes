$f(a)$ is the remainder when is divided by $(x-a)$, if $f(a)=0$, then $(x-a)$ is a factor of $f(x)$

$$\text{Let }f(x) = ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$$
$$\text{Where }f(a)=0, (x-a) \text{ is a factor of }f(x)$$
*Once we've found a factor of $f(x)$, we can use [[Division - Box Method]], to turn the polynomial into a quadratic
