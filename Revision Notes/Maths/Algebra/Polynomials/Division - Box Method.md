Here is an example of the *box method* being used to multiply the two polynomials $(x^2+3x-2)$ and $(2x-3)$

| | |$x^2$|$3x$ |$-2$ |
|---|---|---|---|--- |
|$2x$|~|$2x^3$|$6x^2$|$-4x$|
|$-3$|~|$-3x^2$|$-9x$|$6$|

$(x^2+3x-2)\cdot(2x-3) = 2x^3 +6x^2-3x^2-4x-9x+6=2x^3+3x^2-13x+6$

Using this concept, consider how we would go about *dividing polynomials*

$(2x^3+3x^2-13x+6) / (2x-3)=?$

*Using the box method, immediately there are two slots that we can fill, the term in the polynomial with the highest degree of x goes in the top right, while the term with the lowest degree of x goes in the bottom left (generally the constant)*

| | |$ $ |$ $ |$ $ |
|---|---|---|---|--- |
|$2x$||$2x^3$|$ $ |$ $|
|$-3$||$ $ |$ $|$6$|

*From this point, we use the information we do have to solve the box, almost like a sudoku puzzle*
