**Equation of a circle** : $r^2=(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2$, where $(x,y)$ is the radius and $(a,b)$ are along the circumference 

*Circle Theorem*
- A perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the centre of the circle
- If we can have two perpendicular bisectors of chords, we can find the centre point of the circle using *Simultaneous Equations*
- A triangle plotted along the diameter with all points on the circle will always be a right-angle triangle
