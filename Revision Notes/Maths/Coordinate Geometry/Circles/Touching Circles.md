In geometry, touching circles are defined as circles that have their boundaries in contact but they do not intersect. Basically, two circles are touching each other if they have a single point in common and they also share a tangent at that particular point.

1. Two circles touch externally if the distance between the centres of the two circles is equal to the sum of the radii of the circles.
2. ﻿﻿﻿On the other hand, two circles touch internally if the distance between the centres of the two circles is equal to the difference in radii of the two circles.
