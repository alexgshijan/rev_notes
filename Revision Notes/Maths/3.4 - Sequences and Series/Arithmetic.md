We use $a$ to denote the *first term*, $d$ is the *difference* between terms, and $n$ is the *position* of the term we're interested in. We can express this with : $$u_n=a+(n-1)d$$
**Formula for an arithmetic series :**$$S_n=\frac{n}{2}(2a+d(n-1))$$
*Note : $d(n-1)$ is the last term of the sequence*
