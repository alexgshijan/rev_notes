An Arithmetic Sequence is where you *add* a value to get the next value

We use $a$ to denote the *first term*, $d$ is the *difference* between terms, and $n$ is the *position* of the term we're interested in. We can express this with : $$u_n=a+(n-1)d$$
**Formula for an arithmetic series :**$$S_n=\frac{n}{2}(2a+(n-1)d)$$
*Let's imagine if we summed this up manually, it would look something like this*
$$S_{n}= a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + (a+3d) + ... + (a + (n-1) d)$$
*We begin to notice this pattern, where d increments. But let's try getting rid of that. We flip the order round*
$$S_{n}= (a + (n-1) d) + ... + (a+3d) + (a+2d) + (a+1d) + (a+d)+a$$
*And then add the two together, matching up the terms to sum to (n-1)d*
$$2S_{n}= (2a + (n-1)d) + (2a + (n-1)d) + ... + (2a + (n-1)d)$$
*Let's factorise that*
$$2S_n=n(2a + (n-1)d)$$
*To finally get us*
$$S_n=\frac{n}{2}(2a + (n-1)d)$$

*Note : $a + d(n-1)$ or $l$ is the last term of the sequence*
