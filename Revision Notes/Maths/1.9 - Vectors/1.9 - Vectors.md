**Vectors are directions to get from one point to another**

**Notes :**
- If two vectors have the same magnitude and direction, then they're equal
- Vectors are parallel if one is a multiple of the other
- If two vectors are different signs but otherwise identical, they are parallel and the same length but in the opposite direction
- $|A^{\to}B|$ allows you to calculate the distance of the Vector, you do Pythagoras on the coefficients of the vector units (*eg. 10 from 10a*)
- Collinear points are 3 or more points that are on a single straight line
	- *To prove, show the points are parallel and share a common point*
- It is a given that $i$ represents the $x$ axis and $j$ represents the $y$ axis
**Formulas :**
- The point dividing AB in the ratio $\lambda : \mu$ is $$\frac{\mu a+\lambda b}{\mu +\lambda}$$
- General Formula to find a Vectors unit vector (*magnitude 1*):$$\frac{A^{\to}B}{|A^{\to}B|}$$
