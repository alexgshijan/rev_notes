**Rules of Surds :**
- $\sqrt a \cdot \sqrt a = \sqrt ab$
-  $\sqrt a \div \sqrt a = \sqrt ab$

**General rule for solving surds :**
- Split Surd into largest square factors
- Square 'square' surds 
- Collect like terms

**Rationalising the denominator** : 
To rationalise the denominator of $\frac{1}{a\sqrt{b}+c\sqrt{d}}$, we must multiply the numerator + denominator by $a\sqrt{b}-c\sqrt{d}$, refer to the [[Difference of two squares]]
