We can kinda abuse substitution to make equations that have different powers and turn them into [[Quadratics|quadratics]] and use [[Completing the Square]] to solve for x. 

We can do this by using $\text{let }a =x^n$

Example : $x^4-6x^2+8=0$
$$x^4-6x^2+8=0$$
*let's sub in with the variable so we can rewrite this as a quadratic*
$$\text{let }a =x^{2}, a^2-6a+8=0$$
*Now factorise*
$$a^2-6a+8=(a-4)(a-2)$$
*And finally sub the original values back in*
$$(x^2-4)(x^2-2)=0$$
*We can now find our final solutions*
$$x^{2}=4\text{ or }x^{2}=2\implies x=\pm2\text{ or }x=\pm\sqrt{2}$$
