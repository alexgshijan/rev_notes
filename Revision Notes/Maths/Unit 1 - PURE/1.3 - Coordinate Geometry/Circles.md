**Equation of a circle** : $r^2=(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2$, where $(x,y)$ is the radius and $(a,b)$ are along the circumference 

*Circle Theorem*
- A perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the centre of the circle
- If we can have two perpendicular bisectors of chords, we can find the centre point of the circle using *Simultaneous Equations*
- A triangle plotted along the diameter with all points on the circle will always be a right-angle triangle

*Touching Circles*
In geometry, touching circles are defined as circles that have their boundaries in contact but they do not intersect. Basically, two circles are touching each other if they have a single point in common and they also share a tangent at that particular point.

1. Two circles touch externally if the distance between the centres of the two circles is equal to the sum of the radii of the circles.
2. ﻿﻿﻿On the other hand, two circles touch internally if the distance between the centres of the two circles is equal to the difference in radii of the two circles.
