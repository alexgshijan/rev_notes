**Let's contradict "Prime numbers are finite"**
*Let p equal the largest prime*
$$\text{Let } N = 2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot5\cdot ... \cdot p$$
Consider that N+1 is greater than p, and that N+1 divided by any integer between 2 and p would have a remainder of 1. Therefore N+1 either has other prime factors outside the range 2 to p, or N+1 is a prime itself. Note that in both cases p cannot therefore be the largest prime. As such prime numbers are infinite

**Let's contradict "$\sqrt{2}$ is rational"**
*Assume that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational, so it can be expressed in the form $\frac{m}{n}$ where m and n are integers with no common factor*
$$\sqrt{2}=\frac{m}{n}\implies2=\frac{m^{2}}{n^{2}}\implies2n^{2}=m^{2}$$
As $m^2$ must be even, let's represent m as 2p where p is an integer
$$(2p)^{2}=2n^{2}\implies4p^{2}=2n^{2}\implies2p^{2}=n^{2}$$
We can conclude therefore that $n^2$ is also event. However for both m and to be even (have a common factor of two) contradicts the original premise that the fraction was in it's simplest form. As such $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational
