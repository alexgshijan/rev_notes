*Let's contradict "Prime numbers are finite"*
$\text{Let }p=\text{ the largest prime}$
$\text{Let } N = 2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot5\cdot ... \cdot p$
*$\text{Note that }N>p\to N+1>p$*
$N+1\text{ divided by any prime number between 2 and p would have a reminder of 1 }$
$\therefore N + 1 \text{ either has other prime factors not within the range of 2}\to p$
$\text{or }N+1\text{ is a prime number itself, both contradicting that p is the largest prime}$
$\therefore\text{Prime numbers are finite}$

*Let's contradict "$\sqrt{2}$ is rational"*
$\text{Assume that }\sqrt{2}\text{ is rational, so it can be expressed in the form }\frac{m}{n}$
$\text{where m and n are integers with no common factor}$
$\sqrt{2}=\frac{m}{n}$
$2=\frac{m^{2}}{n^{2}}$
$2n^{2}=m^{2}$
$\therefore m^{2}\text{must be even and so }m\text{ must be even}$
$\therefore m \text{ can be written as 2p where p is an integer}$
$(2p)^{2}=2n^{2}$
$4p^{2}=2n^{2}$
$2p^{2}=n^{2}$
$\therefore n^{2}\text{ must be even}$
$\text{Since both m and n are both even, they have a common factor of 2}$
$\text{This contradicts the original statement}\therefore\sqrt{2}\text{ is irrational}$
