**We can't use [[SUVAT - The Equations of Constant Acceleration]] when acceleration is variable**

Instead, we can use both [[1.8 - Integration]] and [[1.7 - Differentiation]].

Using [[Graphs]] theory, we know that we can derive the following from the gradient and area under the curve

*Differentiation with respect to t :* $x\to v \to a$
*Integration with respect to t :* $a\to v \to x$
