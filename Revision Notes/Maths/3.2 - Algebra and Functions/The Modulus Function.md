*The Modulus or Absolute gives the distance of x from Zero*

**Solving equations with the modulus function where $a$ and $b$ are in terms of x**

*Quadratic Method*
We can use this fact "$|a|=b\to a^{2}=b^{2}$" in order to derive a quadratic from a modulus functions. *This may introduce new solutions so it's important you sub the values back into the original to see if they're valid solutions*

*Possible-Option Method*
We can use this fact "$|a|=b\to a=b \text{ or }-a=b$" in order to work out the possible values of b. *This may introduce new solutions so it's important you sub the values back into the original to see if they're valid solutions*

*Graphical Method*
We plot the graph of "$|a|=b\to y=|a|- b$" to find roots
