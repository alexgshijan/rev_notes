A *mapping* is a rule that transforms one set of numbers into another set of numbers, either described in words or as a algebraic expression

A *function* is a special mapping such that every element of the *domain* (input values) is mapped to exactly one element of the range (output values)

**Notation**
Domain of $f(x)=D(f)$
Range of $f(x)=R(f)$
$a<x<b=(a,b)$ *Note that rounded brackets means not inclusive*
$a\leq x\leq b=[a,b]$
$a<x{\leq}b=(a,b]$

**Inverse Function** undo the the original composite function
*Graphs its inverse are reflections of each other in the line $y=x$*
The *domain* of $f(x)$ is equal to the *range* of $f^{-1}(x)$
The *range* of $f(x)$ is equal to the *domain* of $f^{-1}(x)$
