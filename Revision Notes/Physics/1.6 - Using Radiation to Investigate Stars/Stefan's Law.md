**The total power $P$ of electromagnetic radiation emitted from area $A$ of a [[Black Body]] at temperature $T$ **

Formula :$$P=A\sigma T^4$$Where *(Stefan's Constant)* $\sigma =5.67\cdot10^{-8}\text{ units : }Wm^{-2}K^{-4}$
And $A$ is the Surface Area
And $P$ is the *Total of the power emitted at all wavelengths.*

Area of a Circle = $4\pi r^2$
