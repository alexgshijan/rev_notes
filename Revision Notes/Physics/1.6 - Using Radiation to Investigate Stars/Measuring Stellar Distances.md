Over a period of half a year, a nearby star appears to shift when seen against the background of much more distant stars. Using trig **we can calculate the distance by dividing Earth's Diameter by the angle between earth and the star in units radians**

We can also use [[Inverse Square Law]] against objects of known brightnesses
