**This is extremely redshifted radiation from the Big Bang, It was originally high energy Gamma waves, now cooled down and stretched to microwaves/ radio waves**
When the universe was less than 380,000 years old all atoms were ionised due to high temperature. 
The Universe then cooled to 3000K so hydogen atoms could form and space became transparent to radiation. This is CMBR
