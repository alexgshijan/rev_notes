**Telescopes :**
*Most ground based observations are made by microwave or radio telescopes.*
The atmosphere is transparent to short wavelengths while others are blocked by the atmosphere

**Synchrotron Radiation :**
*When electrons spiral around magnetic field lines, they give off Synchrotron radiation*
Lots of objects generate intense magnetic fields and give of lots of Synchrotron Radiation 
Planets generate Synchrotron Radiation at radio wavelengths 
Neutron stars give off beams of Synchrotron Radiation, if these beams flash over Earth we see pulsars
Supernovae make synchrotron radiation in Visible or UV wavelengths

**CMBR :**
*This is extremely redshifted radiation from the Big Bang, It was originally high energy Gamma waves, now cooled down and stretched to microwaves/ radio waves*
When the universe was less than 380,000 years old all atoms were ionised due to high temperature. 
The Universe then cooled to 3000K so hydogen atoms could form and space became transparent to radiation. This is CMBR 

**21cm Hydrogen :**
As an atom of hydrogen is excited it absorbs or emits radiation with the specific wavelength of 21.1 cm
Radiation with this wavelength indicates the presence of atomic hydrogen
Sensitivity of radio telescopes enables astronomers to detect very tenuous hydrogen clouds on the edge of galaxies
We can measure the orbital velocity of thee clouds using Doppler shift and this provides evidence for dark matter

**Multi-wavelength Astronomy :**
The higher the temperature of the object the shorter the wavelength it emits, so we need to choose what wavelength is most suitable to use. 
Our atmosphere absorbs gamma, X Ray and most UV, It also absorbs certain wavelengths of IR wavelengths.
