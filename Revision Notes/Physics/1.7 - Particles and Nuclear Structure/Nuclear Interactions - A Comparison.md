| Interaction| Experienced by | Range | Comments|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Gravitational | All particles| Infinite *-if mass is large enough* | Responsible for attraction between astronomic objects |
|Weak | All particles | Short *$10^{-18}$m* | Only responsible where electromagnetic and strong interactions do not occur, also responsible for radioactive $\beta$ decay |
|Electromagnetic | All charged particles (*also felt by neutral hadrons*) | Infinite | Holds together a whole atom |
|Strong | All Hadrons | Short *$10^{-15}$m* | Holds nuclei together|

*Note that the table is in the order of weakest to strongest*
