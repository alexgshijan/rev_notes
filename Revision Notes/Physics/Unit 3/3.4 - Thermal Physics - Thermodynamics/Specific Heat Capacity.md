Solids and liquids don't change their volume much, so work done is negligible. Since change in internal energy is dependant on temperature, *the rise in temperature of an object is proportional to heat input (if no change of state).*

*Formula :*$$Q=mc\Delta\theta$$*where :*
- Q is the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperate of mass m of a solid or liquid by $\Delta\theta$ temperature (any units)
- c is the specific heat capacity

*Specific Heat Capacity - The heat energy required to raise the temperature of 1kg of a substance by 1 degree with units $Jkg^{-1}K^{-1}$*

*Heat Transfer between two systems in thermal contact*
Assuming that no heat is lost outside these 2 systems, the temperature loss of one system will equal the gain in the other and so : $m_{1}c_{1}(\theta_{1}-\theta)=m_{2}c_{2}(\theta_{2}-\theta)$
