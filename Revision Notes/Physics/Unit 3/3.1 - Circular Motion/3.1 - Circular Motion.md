**Formula for angular velocity, measured in $\text{rad}s^{-1}$**$$\omega=\frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta t}=\frac{2\pi}{T}=2f\pi\therefore T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}\therefore v=r\omega$$*where*
- T is the time period
- r is the angle in radians
- $\omega$ is angular velocity
- v is linear velocity
- f is frequency

Centripetal Force
*There is a change in direction, so there must be a constant changing velocity. If there is a constant chance in velocity, there must be an acceleration toward the centre of the circle. $F=Ma$ dictates that there must also be a force in play. This force towards the centre is the centripetal force.* [(Click here for a diagram)](https://xmphysics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-109.png)The centrifugal force is just a reaction force to the centripetal force.
$$a_{centripetal}=\frac{v^{2}}{r} \therefore F_{centripetal}=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}$$

*Motion in a vertical circle*
$$T_{bottom}=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}+mg\text{ and } T_{top}=\frac{mv^2}{r}-mg$$
*At $T_{sides}$ use trig to calculate the force of mg.*

*Motion in a horizontal circle*
$$F=T\sin\theta=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}\therefore T_{Vertical}=T_{Total}\cos\theta$$
