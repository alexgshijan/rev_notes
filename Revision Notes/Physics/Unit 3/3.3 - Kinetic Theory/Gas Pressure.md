*Air pressure is caused by the force of air particles bumping into things. Air pressure is equal in all directions.* 

The molecules each suffer a momentum change when they collide with something and this causes a change in momentum according to Newton’s Second law. The molecules then exert an equal and opposite force on the walls of the container according to Newton’s third law.

*What is an ideal gas?*

“A gas having particles that have perfectly elastic collisions and negligible volume and no intermolecular forces, thus exactly obeying the ideal gas law”.
*No known gas is an ideal gas, but actual gases approximate this behaviour at relatively low pressure and high temperature.*
