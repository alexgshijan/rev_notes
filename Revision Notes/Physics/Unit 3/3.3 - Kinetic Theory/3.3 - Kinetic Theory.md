**Moles and Molecules**
*A mole is the amount that contains as many particles as the number of atoms in 12g of Carbon-12. This number of particles is called Avogadro’s constant or $6.02*10^{23}$*

**Absolute Zero**
*This is the temperature where the average kinetic energy of the particle is zero.* 273.15˚C = 0K

**Ideal Gas Equation**$$pV=nRT$$*where :*
- p is pressure 
- V is volume
- n is number of moles 
- R is Gas Constant 8.31 $Jmol^{-1}K^{-1}$
- T is Temperature
*An ideal gas strictly obeys this equation. With the exception of very high densities a real gas approximates well to an ideal gas*
