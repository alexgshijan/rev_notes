**Moles and Molecules**
*A mole is the amount that contains as many particles as the number of atoms in 12g of Carbon-12. This number of particles is called Avogadro’s constant or $6.02*10^{23}$*

**Absolute Zero**
*This is the temperature where the average kinetic energy of the particle is zero.* 273.15˚C = 0K

**Ideal Gas Equation**$$pV=nRT=NkT=\frac{Nm\bar{c^{2}}}{3}$$*where :*
- p is pressure 
- V is volume
- n is number of moles 
- R is Gas Constant 8.31 $Jmol^{-1}K^{-1}$
- T is Temperature
- N is number of molecules
- k is Boltzmann constant $1.38\cdot10^{-23}jK^{-1}$
*An ideal gas strictly obeys this equation. With the exception of very high densities a real gas approximates well to an ideal gas*

*The kinetic theory relates the macroscopic behaviour of an ideal gas with the microscopic properties of its molecules.*

*Assumptions of the kinetic theory*
- Gas particles are in constant, random motion.
- Travel in straight lines.
- Elastic collisions.
- Create a pressure when colliding with surface of container.
- Volume of the molecules is negligible.
- Time for collisions is smaller than time between collisions 
- Lots of molecules 
- Random distribution of energy.

**Total Kinetic Energy Formula for monatomic gas :**$$E_{k}=\frac{3nRT}{2}=\frac{3NkT}{2}=\frac{Nm\bar{c^{2}}}{2}$$
*We can derive this by setting $nRT$ equal to $\frac{Nm\bar{c^{2}}}{3}$ and multiplying through by $\frac{3}{2}$*
