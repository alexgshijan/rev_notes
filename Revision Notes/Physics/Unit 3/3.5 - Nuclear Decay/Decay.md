*Alpha*
When an unstable nucleus decays by emitting an alpha particle it loses 4 nucleons so *its nucleon/mass number decreases by 4*. Since it also loses 2 protons, *its proton number decreases by 2.* 

*Beta*$^{-}$
This is the emission of an electron from the nucleus. A neutron changes to a proton, which stays in the nucleus and an electron (which is emitted as a Î²-particle). *This means that the proton number increases by 1, while the total nucleon number remains the same.*
