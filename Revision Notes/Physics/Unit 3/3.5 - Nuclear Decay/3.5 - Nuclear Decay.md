Radiation : *The strong nuclear force holds the nucleons in place but it only extends over a short range. The electrostatic force acting between the protons is repulsive and extends over a large range. So in a large nucleus more neutrons are needed to hold the nucleus together, because they increase the effect of the strong force. However, adding too many neutrons will make the nucleus unstable*

Background radiation also exists from CMBR, Cosmic Rays, Radon Gas, Food and Drink, Buildings, Medical and Nuclear power. When taking radiation counts, we need to account for background radiation. We measure this by taking three separate measurement over 100 seconds.

*Types of Radiation :*
- Alpha: Fast moving particles, helium nuclei, ejected from certain radioactive nuclei 
- Beta: Electrons with speeds (energy) just less than the speed of light, ejected from certain radioactive nuclei
- Gamma: Photons of high energy (high frequency, short wavelength EM wave) ejected from radioactive nuclei

Alpha particles will repel the positive electric and magnetic field due to its positive charge. Beta particles will attract the positive electric and magnetic field due to its negative charge. *In both cases alpha particles are deflected in the opposite direction to beta particles because they have the opposite charge*

Alpha particles have a much greater mass than electrons. Alpha particles have twice the charge of the beta particle. *Therefore alpha particles are deflected less than beta particles, because they require a greater force to deflect them by the same amount*

*When using Flemming's Left hand rule, `X` represents fields flowing into the paper, `.` represents fields flowing out of the paper. Also note that Beta-particles curve in the opposite direction to the flemming rule.*
