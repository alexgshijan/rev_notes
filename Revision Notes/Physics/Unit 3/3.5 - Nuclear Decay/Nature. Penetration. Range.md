α-particles, β-particles and γ-ray photons are all very energetic particles. *We often measure their energy in electron-volts (eV) rather than joules.*

Typically the kinetic energy of an α-particle is about 6 million eV (6MeV). We know that radiation ionises molecules by ‘knocking’ electrons off them. As it does so, *energy is transferred from the radiation to the material*.

*Strongly ionising particles in motion lose energy quickly and therefore less penetrating (for a given initial energy)*

Since the alpha particle is heavy, relatively slow moving and has a charge of $+2e$, it interacts strongly with matter. It produces about $1 × 10^{5}$ ion pairs per cm of its path in air. *After passing through just a few cm of air it has lost its energy.*

Beta is much lighter than the alpha particle and it travels much faster. Since it spends just a short time in the vicinity of each air molecule and has a charge of only $-1e$, it causes less ionisation. It produces about $1 × 10^{3}$ ion pairs per cm in air and so *it travels about 1m before being absorbed.*

Gamma interacts weakly with matter because it is uncharged and therefore it is difficult to stop. *A gamma photon often loses all of its energy in one event. However, the chance of such an event is small and on average a γ-ray photon travels a long way before it is absorbed*
