*When a wave passes obliquely (neither perpendicular nor parallel) from one medium to another, it's direction of travel and speed change. However the frequency is constant.*

*Snell's Law*
Angle of incidence is equal to angle of refraction for a specific wavelength. $\frac{\sin\theta_{1}}{\sin\theta_{2}}$ is constant

*Absolute refractive index*
Light travels more slowly in any medium other than a vacuum. We use the quantity absolute refractive index to compare the speed of a wave in a particular medium to its speed in a vacuum. 
$$n=\frac{c}{v}$$
*where :*
- The refractive index is n
- the speed of light is c
- the speed of light in the medium is v

*All this can be written as :*
$$n_1\sin\theta_1=n_2\sin\theta_2$$
