*When a wave passes obliquely (neither perpendicular nor parallel) from one medium to another, it's direction of travel and speed change. However the frequency is constant.*

*Snell's Law*
Angle of incidence is equal to angle of refraction for a specific wavelength. $\frac{\sin\theta_{1}}{\sin\theta_{2}}$ is constant

*Absolute refractive index*
Light travels more slowly in any medium other than a vacuum. We use the quantity absolute refractive index to compare the speed of a wave in a particular medium to its speed in a vacuum. 
$$n=\frac{c}{v}$$
*where :*
- The refractive index is n
- the speed of light is c
- the speed of light in the medium is v

*All this can be written as :*
$$n_1\sin\theta_1=n_2\sin\theta_2$$

*Total Internal Refraction*
Total internal refraction occurs when both the light is in the more dense medium and approaching the less dense medium and the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle.

*Deriving the critical angle*
$$n_{1}\sin C=n_{2}\sin90\therefore n_{1}\sin C=n_{2}$$
*Deriving alpha*
$$\alpha=90-C$$
*Optical fibres*
Step index multimode optical fibre cables consist of a long thin glass core surrounded by a layer of cladding, made from glass or plastic of a lower refractive index. Light can travel in a variety of different ways- hence multimode.

Monomode however lets light travel in a extremely limited way, where alpha is 0. We can achieve this by making the cable core's radius equal to the wavelength
