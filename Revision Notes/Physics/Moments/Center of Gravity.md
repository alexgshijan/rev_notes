**Types of Equilibrium :**
- Neutral - No matter the force applied, the centre of gravity remains on top of the pivot point. It cannot 'fall' :
```desmos-graph
9=(x-0)^{2}+(y-3)^{2}
y=0
```
- Stable - The moment will bring the object back to it's original point after a force is applied :
```desmos-graph
9=(x-0)^{2}+(y-3)^{2}
y=0.05x^2
```
- Unstable - The moment will take the object away from it's original point after a force is applied :
```desmos-graph
9=(x-0)^{2}+(y-3)^{2}
y=-0.05x^2
```


In an regular shape made of a single material, the centre of gravity would be the exact centre of the shape. 

However most objects are not truly uniform. The method of finding the centre of gravity of an irregular Lamina is plotting the stable equilibrium point on each dimension
