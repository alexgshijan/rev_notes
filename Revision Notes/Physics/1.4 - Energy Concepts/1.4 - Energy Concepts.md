*If friction forces are present then this equation must be adjusted to take this into account :*$$Fx-\text{work done against friction}=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}-\frac{1}{2}mu^{2}$$
*Work Done :*
This is the force applied to an object, where the object moves in the direction of the force. Also considered the energy transferred to the object
