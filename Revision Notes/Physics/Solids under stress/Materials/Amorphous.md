These are materials that have randomly arranged atoms - *there aren't many examples*. These include *cast iron, glass and brick*, which have no long range order in the way the atoms are arranged, though there may be ordered clusters of atoms.

![Brittle Stress Strain](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Stress_strain_comparison_brittle_ductile.svg)
As observed on the brittle curve, these amorphous materials have no plastic region. They have the stiffness and brittleness of [[Crystalline - Polycrystalline]] materials, without their large-scale regularity of structure or planes of weakness. They have an *amorphous structure*, with no regularity in the way that their molecules are locked together in the solid.

The lack of crystalline structure makes dislocation slip impossible - there isn't enough long or short range order for dislocations to move. This means that stress which builds up on a surface crack is not 'relieved' by the movement of dislocations, as would happen in a ductile material.  Hence, glass may be stiff, but it certainly isn't strong.

*You could increase the strength of these materials by :*
- Add Fibres 
- Pre stress the material
