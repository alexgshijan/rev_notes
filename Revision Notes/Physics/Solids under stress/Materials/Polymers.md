Polymers have strong covalent bonds that form between adjacent molecules, if the molecules don't have many cross links, then they can slide over each other quite easily - *An Example being rubber*. If you increase the number of crosslinks, by adding impurities such as sulphur, then you can increase the rigidity

Rubber molecules are long and thin, resembling rods with swivel joints at periodic intervals. The cross links are strong covalent bonds however this aspect isn't that common in naturally forming latex, hence why it isn't a tangled mess.
