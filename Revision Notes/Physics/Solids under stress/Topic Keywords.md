- Hookes Law's  - **The tension in a spring or wire is proportional to its extension from its natural length, provided the extension is not too great**
- Plastic - **A material deformed after force is applied and then taken away**
- Elastic - **A material that returns to it's original form after force is applied and then taken away**
- Elastic limit : **the furthest point it can be stretched or deformed while being able to return to its previous shape**. When an elastic object is stretched beyond its elastic limit, the object does not return to its original length or shape when the force is removed.
