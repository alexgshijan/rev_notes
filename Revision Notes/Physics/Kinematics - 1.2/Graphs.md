**Displacement-Time :**
- The gradient of the graph gives velocity 
- A straight line indicates a constant velocity 
- A horizontal line indicates that the displacement is not changing

**Velocity-Time :**
- 
**Acceleration-Time :** 
- 
~Compare net positive and negative areas to find net acceleration
