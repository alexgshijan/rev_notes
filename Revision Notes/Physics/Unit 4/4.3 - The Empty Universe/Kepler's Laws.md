**First Law**
The orbit of each planet is an ellipse which has the Sun at one focus

**Second Law**
Each planet moves in such a way that radius vector (the line joining it to the Sun) sweeps out equal areas in equal times.

**Third Law**
The square of the period of the orbit is directly proportional to the cube of the semi major axis $T^{2}\propto r^{3}$ - The period of orbit of an object in a circular orbit is the same as that of an object in an elliptical orbit with the same semi major axis (radius). $$T^{2}=\frac{4\pi^{2}}{GM}r^{3}$$*where :*
- G is Gravitational constant $6.67\cdot 10^{-11}$. 
- M is Mass of the central object
- T is the time period of oscillation
- r is the semi major axis, or rather, radius
