**Quantaties** can only be added/subtracted if they have the same units 
You can be asked to check the homogeneity of different formulas

Example :
- Formula : $v^2=u^2+2ax$
- Both $v$ and $u$ are velocities in the equation, using [[Derived Quantaties]] we know the units of velocity is $ms^{-1}$, $v^{2}= (ms^{-1})^2=m^2s^{-2}$
- $a$ represents accelaration in this equation, using [[Derived Quantaties]]  we know that the units of accelaration are $ms^{-2}$, the units of $l$ representing length is $m$, $ms^{-2} \cdot m=m^2s^{-2}$
- As we can see all the terms within the formula have the units $m^2s^{-2}$
