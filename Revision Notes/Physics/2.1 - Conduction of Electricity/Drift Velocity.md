**Electrons in a metal have a random speed (at room temp) of $10^{5}ms^{-1}$**
They move in any direction and collide with the lattice ions and other electron.
*Random Movement = zero drift velocity*

When a potential difference is applied, they are given a very slow average velocity *- drift velocity* 

**Formula :**$$I=nAve$$
*Where :*
- Current is $I$ with units $A$
- No. *free* electrons per unit volume is $n$ with units $m^{-3}$
- Cross sectional area is $A$ with units $m^{2}$
- Velocity is $V$ with units $ms^{-1}$
- Charge of electrons is $e$ with units $C$

*Derive :*
- We can find the volume of material with $v\Delta tA$
- if we multiply that by No. *free* electrons per unit volume, we get the total electron in the material with $v\Delta tAn$
- Multiply that by the charge of an electron to get total charge with $Q=v\Delta tAne$
- $I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}\therefore I = vAne$
