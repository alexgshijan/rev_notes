When certain materials are rubbed they can loose/ gain electrons. **This can be observed as a change in it's charge**. We can measure this with a [[Coulomb Meter]] 

**Charge of an electron :**$$e^{-}=1.6\cdot 10^{-19}$$
**Law of conservation of charge :**
Electrical charge cannot be created or destroyed. Charge cannot pile up to a point in a circuit
