**Moment = Force x Perpendicular distance**

*It's important to make sure that the force and distance are at 90Ëš from each other*

We can use [[Trigonometry - 2.1.5]] to calculate the perpendicular distance if it isn't given to us in the question

**Principle of moments :** In equilibrium, the sum of the clockwise moments is equal to the sum of the anticlockwise moments
