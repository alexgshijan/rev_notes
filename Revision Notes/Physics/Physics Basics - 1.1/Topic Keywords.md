Accuracy : **How close the result is to the true value**
Precise : **How close the results are to each other**
Repeatable : **How similar results are when the experiment is repeated**
Reproducible : **How similar results are when the experiment is repeated by others**
Static : **When forces are in equilibrium**
Dynamic : **When it is not Static**
