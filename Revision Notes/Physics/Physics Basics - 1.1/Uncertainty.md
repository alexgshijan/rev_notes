**Absolute Uncertainty :**
If you've taken a single reading, it can calculated as the resolution of the instrument, if multiple readings were taken, it is equal to half the range of results 
This can also be expressed as a percentage of the measured value

**Percentage Uncertainty :**
$\frac{\text{uncertainty}}{\text{measurement}}\cdot100=\text{percentage uncertainty}$

**Combining Uncertainty :**
If an equation has multiply or divide, add the percentage uncertainties.
If an equation has the power $n$, multiply the percentage uncertainty by $n$
