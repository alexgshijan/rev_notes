*A Black body is a body which absorbs all EM radiation that falls on it.*
No body is a better emitter of radiation at any wavelength than a black body, at a given temperature.

Things that absorb radiation also emit radiation
Black bodies are a theoretical standard we compare other objects to

Stars obviously aren't black but there are almost perfect emitters so when we look at the light they emit, we should get a continuous spectrum. 
They are a good approximation of a black body. When it is cold, it appears black and when it heats up, it begins to emit various wavelengths of light.

This also leads into the why different stars have different colours $\to$ [[Sun's Temperature]]
