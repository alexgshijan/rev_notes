As an atom of hydrogen is excited it absorbs or emits radiation with the specific wavelength of 21.1 cm
Radiation with this wavelength indicates the presence of atomic hydrogen
Sensitivity of radio [[Telescopes]] enables astronomers to detect very tenuous hydrogen clouds on the edge of galaxies
We can measure the orbital velocity of thee clouds using Doppler shift and this provides evidence for dark matter
