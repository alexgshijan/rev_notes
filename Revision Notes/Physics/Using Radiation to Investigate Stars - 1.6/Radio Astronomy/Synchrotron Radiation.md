**When electrons spiral around magnetic field lines, they give off Synchrotron radiation**
Lots of objects generate intense magnetic fields and give of lots of Synchrotron Radiation 
Planets generate Synchrotron Radiation at radio wavelengths 
Neutron stars give off beams of Synchrotron Radiation, if these beams flash over Earth we see pulsars
Supernovae make synchrotron radiation in Visible or UV wavelengths
