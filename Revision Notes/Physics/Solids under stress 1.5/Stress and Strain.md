**Topic Keywords :**
- Tensile Stress
	- Definition : **Force per unit cross-sectional area when equal opposing forces act on a body**
	- Units Δ
	- Formula : $σ= \frac{F}{A}$
		- Where F is Force and A is cross-sectional area
- Tensile Strain 
	- Definition : **The extension per unit length due to an applied stress**
	- Units : N/a
	- Formula : $ε = \frac{Δl}{l}$
		- Where l is the length and Δl is extension
- Young Modulus
	- Definition : **The ration of stress to strain, can be used to identify and compare the stiffness of different materials, regardless of dimensions of the spring**
	- Units : $σ= \frac{F}{A}$
	- Formula = $\frac{σ}{ε}$
	- Take note : This only applies until the elastic limit of the material, as referred to in [[Physics/Solids under stress 1.5/Topic Keywords|Hooke's Law]]
