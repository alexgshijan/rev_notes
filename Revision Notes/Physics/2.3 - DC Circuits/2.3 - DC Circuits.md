*Conservation of Charge*
Kirschoff's First Law states *"The sum of the currents coming in to a point in a circuit equals the sum of the currents going out of it"*

*Conservation of Energy*
*"Energy cannot be created or destroyed"* Since $V=\frac{W}{Q}$
If two or more cells are added, the potential difference is the sum of potential differences of the cells. The sum potential difference of the components should equal the sum potential difference of the cells.

*Resistors*
In series  $\to R_{T}=R_{1}+R_{2}...$
In parallel $\to \frac{1}{R_{T}}=\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}...$

*Potential Dividers*
We can use a combination of resistors to get specific potential difference
