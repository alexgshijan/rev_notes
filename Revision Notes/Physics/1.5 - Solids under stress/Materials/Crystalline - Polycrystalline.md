Metals and salts have regular atomic patterns, which means any force exerted on a crystalline material will therefore be transmitted equally to each bond. 

Plastic Dislocation occurs when a solid is extended beyond its elastic limit. The atoms in one plane can slip over the ato ms in another plane. *This is also known as edge dislocation and it is the essence of plastic deformation.*

Edge Dislocation occurs when the atoms have not bonded correctly, often mistakes occur when the material was cooled to fast, and so there are planes of atoms missing from within the material. We can observe this on the image below :

When force is applied in excess of the elastic limit, the position of this 'half plane' can shift within the material, causing permanent changes to the structure and in turn, plastic dislocation .

Metals can be strengthened by :
- Having smaller grains - restricts the movement of dislocations
- Introducing foreign atoms - inhibits the movements of dislocations
