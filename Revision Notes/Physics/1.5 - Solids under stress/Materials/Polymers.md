Polymers have strong covalent bonds that form between adjacent molecules, if the molecules don't have many cross links, then they can slide over each other quite easily - *An Example being rubber*. If you increase the number of crosslinks, by adding impurities such as sulphur, then you can increase the rigidity

We can relate the curve to party balloons. The First Blow (A$\to$B) - The first blow hard. Then hard again (B $\to$C) and finally BANG  (C)

Rubber molecules are long and thin, resembling rods with swivel joints at periodic intervals. The cross links are strong covalent bonds however this aspect isn't that common in naturally forming latex, hence why it isn't a tangled mess.

Van der Waals forces are weak bonds formed in the tangled mess of molecules, between molecules - They keep molecules stuck together. This explains A $\to$ B - The initial stiffness of the rubber material.

The strength of these van der Waal decrease very rapidly with distance. At point B the molecules have detangled. This is why from C $\to$ E there is a large extension with minimal force inputted. 

Once the molecules have been detangled, stretching the material any further requires the strong covalent bond between each molecule be lengthened, as well as lengthening or breaking the strong cross links between molecules. This is much harder than simply unravelling the molecules. This can be observed from E $\to$ F
