The curve for the extension of a material is often different to the curve for the contraction. This is especially true for a polymeric material, again because of those cross-links

The Work done over one extension-contraction cycle is released as heat, and its value is equal to the area between the two curves

**They Sometimes require you to find the area in between the curves**

#wip  - We could [[Integration - 2.1.8||Integrate]] the two lines are find the difference.
