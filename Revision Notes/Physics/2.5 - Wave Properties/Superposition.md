*The principle of superposition states that the total displacement at any one point is the vector sum f their individual displacements at that point when the waves are in phase and monochromatic*

Superposition will generate a new wave which is the vector sum of the two waves.

*If the sources are not coherent, the waves will still interfere, it the pattern will not be steady*

Coherent sources have the same frequency with wavefronts continuous across the width of the beam and with a constant phase relationship. Coherent light - monochromatic light with a wavefront continuous across the width of the beam. *Coherent sources have the same frequency and a constant phase difference between them*

| Two speakers at the same frequency | Speakers at different frequency  |
| Microwaves going through a double slit originating from the same sources  | Dippers in a ripple tank at different frequency  |
