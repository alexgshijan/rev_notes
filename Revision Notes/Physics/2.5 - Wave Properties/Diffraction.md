*Diffraction is the spreading out of waves when they meet obstacles, such as the edges of a slit. Some of the wave's energy travels into the geometrical shadows of the obstacles*

When the wavelength of the wave is equal to or greater than the width of a slit, waves spread as roughly semi-circular wavefront
