*A light source that produces a beam of highly coherent and very nearly monochromatic light a a result of emission of protons from many atoms*

Laser stands for *Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation*

| Hot Filament lamp | Laser                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Polychromatic     | Single colour/ wavelength is emitted        |
| Incoherent        | Coherent - Inphase *see [[Superposition]] * |
| Divergent         | Collimated - Focused on one point           |

*Since each photon has a probability of being reflected, it then works to carry on 'amplifying' until it is able to pass through the partially reflective mirror* 

*Efficiency Considerations*
- Energy needed for pumping is larger than energy outputted from [[Stimulated Emission]] 
- Due to the high energy intensities needed, the amplifying mediums will get really hot. In order to maintain the integrity of the equipment, we need to cool the system, this requires even more input energy

*We can combat the inefficiency issues by using Laser Diodes:*

| Advantages           | Disadvantages                                   | Uses                      |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Cheaper              | Unable to produce very high powered beams       | Inside DVD and CD Players |
| Smaller              | Difficult to produce a beam with a small spread | Barcode Readers           |
| More Efficient       |                                                 | Optical Fibres            |
| East to mass produce |                                                 | Image Scanning            |
