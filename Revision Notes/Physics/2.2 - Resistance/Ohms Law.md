**The current, $I$, through a conductor is proportional to the [[Potential Difference]], $V$, across it** - Provided the temperature remains constant

**Formula :**$$V=IR$$*where :*
- Resistance is $R$ with units $\ohm$ 
- [[Potential Difference]] is $V$ with units $V$
- Current is $I$ with units $A$
*Note : Only when temperature is constant*

**Ohmic Conductor** - Constant resistance *given that temperature is constant*
**Non-Ohmic Conductor** - Variable resistance
