As *free electrons* travel through a conductor they collide with *metal ions*. This is called *Resistance*. All materials have some resistance

In each collision, some energy is transferred from the electrons to the metal ions, increasing their random kinetic energy. This causes the temperature of the metal to increase.

*Factors that affect Resistance*
- Temperature 
	- Increasing the temperature increases the vibrational energy of ions, this causes more collisions to happen, increasing resistance 
- Length
	- Increasing the length of wire increases the number of ions each electron collides with, this increases the resistance 
- Cross-Sectional Area
	- Increasing the CSA of the wire provides more paths for electrons to pass between ions, this reduces the number of collisions therefore decreases the resistance

The **resistance** of a conductor is the *Potential Difference* placed across it divided by the resulting current through it

**Formula**$$R=\frac{V}{A}$$*where :*
- Resistance is $R$ with units $\ohm$ 
- Potential Difference is $V$ with units $V$
- Current is $A$ with units $A$


The **potential difference** between two points is the amount of *energy transferred from electrical potential energy* to other forms per *Coulomb of charge* flowing between the points

**Formula :**$$V=\frac{W}{Q}$$*where :*
- Voltage is $V$ with units $V$
- Energy is $W$ with units $J$
- Charge is $Q$ with units [[Electron charge|C]]

The *current*, $I$, through a conductor is proportional to the *Potential Difference*, $V$, across it - **Provided the temperature remains constant**

**Formula :**$$V=IR$$*where :*
- Resistance is $R$ with units $\ohm$ 
- Potential Difference is $V$ with units $V$
- Current is $I$ with units $A$
*Note : Only when temperature is constant*

**Ohmic Conductor** - Constant resistance *given that temperature is constant*
**Non-Ohmic Conductor** - Variable resistance 


**Resistivity** is a measure of how strongly a material opposes the flow of current. It is measured in $\ohm m$

Formula for *resistance* using **Resistivity** :$$R=\frac{pl}{A}$$*where :*
- Resistance is $R$ with units $\ohm$ 
- Length is $l$ with units $m$
- Resistivity is $p$ with units $\ohm m$
- CSA is $A$ with units $m^{2}$

**Note :**
- Resistance is a property of a particular component *given a fixed temperature*
- Resistivity is a property of a particular material *given a fixed temperature*
