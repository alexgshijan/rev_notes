As *free electrons* travel through a conductor they collide with *metal ions*. This is called *Resistance*. All materials have some resistance

In each collision, some energy is transferred from the electrons to the metal ions, increasing their random kinetic energy. This causes the temperature of the metal to increase.

**The resistance of a conductor is the [[Potential Difference]] placed across it divided by the resulting current through it**

**Formula**$$R=\frac{V}{A}$$*where :*
- Resistance is $R$ with units $\ohm$ 
- [[Potential Difference]] is $V$ with units $V$
- Current is $A$ with units $A$
