The potential difference between two points is the amount of *energy transferred from electrical potential energy* to other forms per *Coulomb of charge* flowing between the points

**Formula :**$$V=\frac{W}{Q}$$*where :*
- Voltage is $V$ with units $V$
- Energy is $W$ with units $J$
- Charge is $Q$ with units [[Electron charge|C]]
