**Vector Composites**
*A Negative Vector is the same as a positive vector in the opposite direction*
If compass directions are used, use compass bearings and calculate the angle from North, clockwise

**Types of errors :**
- Random : *Unpredictable errors caused by things outside our control (eg. changes in room temperature)*
	- Can be reduced by repeating readings, then averaging
- Systematic : *Errors caused by equipment/ operator (eg. reaction time)*
	- can be reduced by calibrating equipment

**Homogeneity :**
*Quantities* can only be added/subtracted if they have the same units 
You can be asked to check the homogeneity of different formulas
Example :
- Formula : $v^2=u^2+2ax$
- Both $v$ and $u$ are velocities in the equation, using [[Derived Quantities]] we know the units of velocity is $ms^{-1}$, $v^{2}= (ms^{-1})^2=m^2s^{-2}$
- $a$ represents acceleration in this equation, using [[Derived Quantities]]  we know that the units of acceleration are $ms^{-2}$, the units of $l$ representing length is $m$, $ms^{-2} \cdot m=m^2s^{-2}$
- As we can see all the terms within the formula have the units $m^2s^{-2}$

**Absolute Uncertainty :**
If you've taken a single reading, it can calculated as the resolution of the instrument, if multiple readings were taken, it is equal to half the range of results 
This can also be expressed as a percentage of the measured value

**Percentage Uncertainty :**
$\frac{\text{uncertainty}}{\text{measurement}}\cdot100=\text{percentage uncertainty}$

**Combining Uncertainty :**
If an equation has multiply or divide, add the percentage uncertainties.
If an equation has the power $n$, multiply the percentage uncertainty by $n$

Accuracy : **How close the result is to the true value**
Precise : **How close the results are to each other**
Repeatable : **How similar results are when the experiment is repeated**
Reproducible : **How similar results are when the experiment is repeated by others**
Static : **When forces are in equilibrium**
Dynamic : **When it is not Static**
