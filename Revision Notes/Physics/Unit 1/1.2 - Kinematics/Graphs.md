**Displacement-Time :**
- The gradient of the graph gives velocity 
- A straight line indicates a constant velocity 
- A horizontal line indicates that the displacement is not changing
- The area under the curve gives *nothing*
- Compare net positive and negative areas to find *nothing*

**Velocity-Time :**
- The gradient of the graph gives acceleration 
- A straight line indicates a constant acceleration  
- A horizontal line indicates that the velocity is not changing
- The area under the curve gives displacement
- Compare net positive and negative areas to find net displacement 

**Acceleration-Time :** 
- The gradient of the graph gives *jerk*
- A straight line indicates a constant *jerk*
- A horizontal line indicates that the acceleration is not changing
- The area under the curve gives velocity
- Compare net positive and negative areas to find net acceleration
