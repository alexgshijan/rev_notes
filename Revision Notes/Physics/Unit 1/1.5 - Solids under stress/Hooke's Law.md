**Formula :**$$F = k x$$
*where :*
F is the applied force (N)
x is the extension (m), the stretched length - original length
k is the spring constant (Nm<sup>-1</sup>), could be considered the stiffness of the spring 

The spring constant = gradient of the Fx graph
Work done in stretching = area under the Fx graph 
This can also be calculated using $W = 1/2 Fx$

*Assumptions made :*
- Only within elastic limit
-
