- Hooke's Law's  - **The tension in a spring or wire is proportional to its extension from its natural length, provided the extension is not too great**
- Plastic - **A material deformed after force is applied and then taken away**
- Elastic - **A material that returns to it's original form after force is applied and then taken away**
- Elastic limit : **the furthest point it can be stretched or deformed while being able to return to its previous shape**. When an elastic object is stretched beyond its elastic limit, the object does not return to its original length or shape when the force is removed.
- Tensile Stress
	- Definition : **Force per unit cross-sectional area when equal opposing forces act on a body**
	- Units Δ
	- Formula : $σ= \frac{F}{A}$
		- Where F is Force and A is cross-sectional area
- Tensile Strain 
	- Definition : **The extension per unit length due to an applied stress**
	- Units : N/a
	- Formula : $ε = \frac{Δl}{l}$
		- Where l is the length and Δl is extension
- Young Modulus
	- Definition : **The ration of stress to strain, can be used to identify and compare the stiffness of different materials, regardless of dimensions of the spring**
	- Units : $σ= \frac{F}{A}$
	- Formula = $\frac{σ}{ε}$

*Hysteresis*
The curve for the extension of a material is often different to the curve for the contraction. This is especially true for a polymeric material, again because of those cross-links

The Work done over one extension-contraction cycle is released as heat, and its value is equal to the area between the two curves

**They sometimes require you to find the area in between the curves**
