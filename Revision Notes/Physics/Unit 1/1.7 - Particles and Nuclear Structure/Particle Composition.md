*Every particle has an antiparticle with identical mass and equal but opposite charge*
When a particle and it's antiparticle collide, they annihilate each other

**Leptons :**
*Leptons are fundamental particles* - They are not made up of anything else
Examples include Electrons, and it's antiparticle, Positron. Electron Neutrino and Electron Anti Neutrino .

| Particle  | Charge  |
| --- | --- |
| Electron ($e^{-}$) |  -1|
|Electron Neutrino ($V_e$) |0|
**Hadrons :**
*Baryons are an example of Hadron consisting of 3 quarks*
Protons are neutrons are the most common examples of baryons
- Protons are the only stable baryon, consisting of two down quarks and one up quark - All other baryons decay to become a proton
- Neutrons consist of two up quarks and one down
*A meson is a hadron consisting of quark-antiquark pair*
Mesons are made in lots of ways when baryons collide at high energy

**Quarks :**

| Particle  | Charge  |
| --- | --- |
| up ($u$) |  $+\frac{2}{3}$|
| down ($d$)|$-\frac{1}{3}$|
**Quarks are fundamental particles which combine to make Hadrons**
