**The wavelength at which maximum power is emitted is inversely proportional to the Absolute Temperature**

Therefore, as the temperature of the star increases, the peak wavelength of light emitted decreases.

Formula :$$\lambda_{max}=\frac{W}{T}$$Where *(Wien's Constant)* $W = 2.9\cdot10^{-3}mK$
And $\lambda_{max}$ is the wavelength of peak emission 
And $T$ is Temperature in Kelvin
