Stars don't have a definite surface, the light we see comes from a layer of gas called the photosphere. Light emitted from a hot object such as a star has a wide range of wavelengths.

**Absolute Temperature :**
At 0˚Kelvin *or -273.15˚Celsius* the energy of particles in a body is the lowest it can possibly be. This is known as Absolute Zero

$$T(K) = \theta˚C + 273.15$$

**Luminosity of a star :**
*Total energy it emits per unit of time in the form of EM radiation* (Unit : W)
So we can use [[Stefan's Law]] to find luminosity instead of power.

**Measuring Stellar Distances :**
Over a period of half a year, a nearby star appears to shift when seen against the background of much more distant stars. Using trig **we can calculate the distance by dividing Earth's Diameter by the angle between earth and the star in units radians**

We can also use [[Inverse Square Law]] against objects of known brightnesses
