**Elastic objects store energy when they are stretched or squashed. They can then do work on other objects when they return to their normal shape**
The energy that they store when they are deformed is known as *Elastic Potential Energy*

We know that $W=Fx$, but this equation only applied for constant forces. However in the context of springs, we apply increasingly large force to stretch our string. We derive the following equation from the graph created from doing the above experiment :
$$W=\frac{1}{2}Fx$$
*This is the area under the graph*
