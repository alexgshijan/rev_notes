In a system where the only forces that are acting are associated with potential energy, the sum of the kinetic and potential energies is constant.
*This does not apply when frictional forces are present*

Where frictional forces are not present, Potential Energy Lost is Kinetic Energy gained.

When friction is taken into account, work will be done by external forces, w can make use of the equation : $$\text{Work done by external forces}=^{\uparrow}E_{k}+^{\uparrow}E_p+\text{Work done against friction}$$
If work is done against external forces, then the equation becomes : $$ ^{\downarrow}E_{k}+^{\downarrow}E_{p}=\text{Work done against friction }+\text{ Work done against external forces}$$
