**Light can act as a wave but it can also behave as a particle**

Energy in a light wave is not a continuous stream but is quantised into little bundles - *A photon is a discrete packet of energy*

**Formula for the energy of a photon:**$$E=hf=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$$*where :*
- Energy is $E$ with units 
- Plank's Constant is $h$ with value $6.63\cdot10^{-34}Js$
- Frequency is $f$ with unit $s^{-1}$
- Wavelength is $\lambda$ with units $m$
- Speed of light is $c$ with value $3\cdot10^{8}ms^{-1}$

**Electron Volt**
*One electronVolt (eV) is the energy of an electron accelerated by a potential difference of 1 Volt*
$1eV=1.6\cdot10^{-19} J$ --> This is an *electron's charge* * [[Potential Difference]]
