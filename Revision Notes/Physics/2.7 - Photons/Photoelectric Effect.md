*When light of a short enough wavelength falls on a surface, electrons are emitted from the surface*

**Gold Leaf Electroscope Experiment**
- The Electroscope is given a negative charge which causes gold lead to lift
- UV light is shone on the zinc plate attached to the electroscope 
- The god leaf drops back to the original position due to electrons leaving the zinc surface, causing the electroscope to lost its negative charge 
- *The gold leaf does not drop if visible light is shone on the zinc plate*

The work function ( $\phi$ ) of a surface is the minimum energy needed to remove an electron from the surface 
Any energy left over will be the kinetic energy of the ejected photoelectron $E_{k\text{ max}}$
The threshold frequency ($f_0$) is the minimum frequency of a photon that will cause the emission of an electron from a metal surface

We can plot $E_{k\text{ max}}=hf-\phi$ on a graph, modelled as $y=mx+c$
