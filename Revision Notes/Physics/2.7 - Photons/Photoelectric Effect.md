*When light of a short enough wavelength falls on a surface, electrons are emitted from the surface*

**Gold Leaf Electroscope Experiment**
- The Electroscope is given a negative charge which causes gold lead to lift
- UV light is shone on the zinc plate attached to the electroscope 
- The god leaf drops back to the original position due to electrons leaving the zinc surface, causing the electroscope to lost its negative charge 
- *The gold leaf does not drop if visible light is shone on the zinc plate*

The work function ( $\phi$ ) of a surface is the minimum energy needed to remove an electron from the surface 
Any energy left over will be the kinetic energy of the ejected photoelectron $E_{k\text{ max}}$
The threshold frequency ($f_0$) is the minimum frequency of a photon that will cause the emission of an electron from a metal surface

We can plot $E_{k\text{ max}}=hf-\phi$ on a graph, modelled as $y=mx+c$

**Vacuum photocell**

**Method :**
- Shine light on *metal* surface
- Increase pd until ammeter just shows zero current
- Read Voltmeter
- Plot a graph of Current against pd

*This pd is called the stopping voltage, because it stops all emitted electrons from reaching the electrode. Electrons with the maximum KE almost reach the electrode before being stopped. This can be written as :*$$E_{k\text{ max}}=eV_{\text{stop}}$$ **Note :**
- We can change this experiment slightly just to demonstrate the Photoelectric Effect
- We do this by :
	- Replacing the variable power supply with batteries
	- Removing the Voltmeter 
	- Using spectrum of light and not specific
