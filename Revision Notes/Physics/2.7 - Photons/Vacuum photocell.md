**Method :**
- Shine light on *metal* surface
- Increase pd until ammeter just shows zero current
- Read Voltmeter
- Plot a graph of Current against pd

*This pd is called the stopping voltage, because it stops all emitted electrons from reaching the electrode. Electrons with the maximum KE almost reach the electrode before being stopped. This can be written as :*$$E_{k\text{ max}}=eV_{\text{stop}}$$ **Note :**
- We can change this experiment slightly just to demonstrate the [[Photoelectric Effect]] 
- We do this by :
	- Replacing the variable power supply with batteries
	- Removing the Voltmeter 
	- Using spectrum of light and not specific
