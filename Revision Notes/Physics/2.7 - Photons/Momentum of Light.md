Since light waves have no mass and since p=mv it seems logical that light would have zero momentum. However, *Light photons have momentum and Particles have a wavelength.*

$$p=\frac{h}{\lambda}=\frac{hf}{c}$$
*where :*
- Momentum is $p$ with units $kgms^{-1}$
- Planck's Constant is $h$ with value $6.63\cdot10^{-34}Js$
- Frequency is $f$ with unit $s^{-1}$
- Wavelength is $\lambda$ with units $m$
- Speed of light is $c$ with value $3\cdot10^{8}ms^{-1}$

$$\lambda=\frac{h}{\sqrt{2mqV}}$$
*where :*
- Mass is $m$ with units $m$
- Planck's Constant is $h$ with value $6.63\cdot10^{-34}Js$
- Charge is $q$ with unit $C$
- Wavelength is $\lambda$ with units $m$
- Voltage is $V$ with units $V$
