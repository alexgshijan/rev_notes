A progressive wave is a pattern of disturbances travelling through a medium and carrying energy with it, involving the particles of the medium oscillating about their equilibrium positions

**Progressive waves transfer energy without any transfer of matter**

**Progressive Transverse Waves**
	The particle oscillations are perpendicular to the direction of travel of the wave
	*Example : EM Spectrum*

**Progressive Longitudinal Waves**
	The particle oscillations are parallel to the direction of travel of the wave
	*Example : Sound waves*
