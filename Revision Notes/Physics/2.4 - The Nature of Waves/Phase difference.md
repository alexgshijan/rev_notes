Two waves *out of phase* have the same wavelength and amplitude and move in the same direction but they are 'out of step with each other'

We can model this with trig waves :
```desmos-graph 
	degreeMode=degrees
    left=-420
    right=420
    top=2
    bottom=-2
---
y=\sin(x)
y=-\cos(x)
```

*To describe the phase difference of two waves, we say it in terms of wavelength or as an angle*
- A phase difference of 0˚ is called *in phase*
	- If in superposition, this is called *constructive Interference*
	- The superposition will be 'double' of their original wave
- A phase difference of 180˚ is called *in antiphase*
	- If in superposition, this is called *destructive interference*
	- The superposition will be nothing as the waves eliminate each other
- Any other phase difference 
	- This superposition will generate a new wave
