*Absorption*
An electron within any atom can be promoted to a higher energy level by absorbing a photon of the correct energy

*Spontaneous Emission*
An electron will drop spontaneously randomly from the excited to the ground state, emitting a photon of the same energy. *It is important to note that spontaneously emitted photons have random phase and direction*

*Simulated Emission*
In simulated emission, a photon of the correct energy passing near an electron in the excited state causes it to drop to the ground state, producing a photon of energy. *We know have two photons of the same frequency which are in phase, polarised in the same direction and travel in the same direction. This is the beginning of light amplification*

*Problems with this system -* You need to send in a photon to promote the electron to a higher state, and then you use another photon to trigger the emission. Two photons are emitted, that's a net sum of 0 photons gained.

*Population Inversion*
To produce a more intense laser beam, we need a situation where simulated emission is more likely than absorption. 

Because simulated emission occurs when electrons are in an excited state, and absorption when electrons are in the ground state, *we need to force more electrons into the upper level*. This is known as population inversion. $N_{2}>N_{1}$

Energy can be supplied to the system so electrons can be excited into higher energy levels - *also known as pumping*. Pumping with a two level laser ends with $N_{2}=N_{1}$

## 3 energy level laser system
1. *Pumping*. Electrons are promoted from the ground state $E_{0}$ to the second excited state $E_{2}$ using an external light source. - *Absorb a photon with energy $E_{2}-E_{0}$* 
2. Electrons drop quickly to the *metastable state* $E_{1}$ due to $E_{2}$ being extremely unstable. 
3. *$N_{2}>N_{1}$* Transition from metastable state to the ground state which produces the laser photons by stimulated emission.

*Note - Step 1 must exceed Step 3 in order to maintain our population inversion*

Because $E_{2}$ is almost always empty, we can keep pumping as much as we want, as a result of this population inversion can be maintained.

## 4 energy level laser system
1. Pumping from $E_{0}\to E_{3}$ 
2. Quick drop to metastable state $E_{2}$ 
3. Since $E_{2}\to E_{1}$ is our producing transition, and since $E_{1}$ is initially empty, we have already attained a population inversion 
4. $E_{1}$ has a short lifetime, so it drops down to $E_{0}$ allowing us to maintain that population inversion and continue that cycle as $E_{0}$ gets populated again
