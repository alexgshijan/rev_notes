In order to move to a higher energy level the electron must absorb a photon. In order to move to a lower energy level the electron must emit a photon. The energy of the photon must be equal to the energy gap.

*Ionisation energy of an atom is the minimum energy needed to remove an electron from the atom in its ground state*

*Emission Spectra*
When an atom is excited, its electron sits in a higher energy level. If it spontaneously emits a photon the electron will move to a lower energy level.

*Absorption Spectra*
An atom can make a transition from a lower energy level to a higher one by absorbing a photon.
