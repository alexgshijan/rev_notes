*Total Internal Refraction*
Total internal refraction occurs when both the light is in the more dense medium and approaching the less dense medium and the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle.

*Deriving the critical angle*
$$n_{1}\sin C=n_{2}\sin90\therefore n_{1}\sin C=n_{2}$$
*Deriving alpha*
$$\alpha=90-C$$
*Optical fibres*
Step index multimode optical fibre cables consist of a long thin glass core surrounded by a layer of cladding, made from glass or plastic of a lower refractive index. Light can travel in a variety of different ways- hence multimode.

Mono-mode however lets light travel in a extremely limited way, where alpha is 0. We can achieve this by making the cable core's radius equal to the wavelength. **This is required for data since  the order that the signals get sent is critical for the data to be comprehended.**

*Remember to consider the angular distance when working with refracted lines compared to a single straight line.*

See how the length of the normal is shorter than the reflected line. In some questions we may be asked to find the delay in time from a bit on path to the next.
