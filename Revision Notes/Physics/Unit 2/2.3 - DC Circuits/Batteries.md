*The emf of a source is the energy converted from some other form to electrical potential energy per coulomb of charge flowing through the source.*

Some of the electrical energy is turned into heat as the current flows through the internal resistance. The larger the current, the larger the potential difference across the internal resistance. Therefore, the output potential difference *or rather it's terminal potential difference* of a battery is slightly less than it's emf, also 


**Formula :**
$$EMF=T.P.d +P.d\text{ across internal resistor}$$
$$V=E-Ir$$*where :*
- Energy converted per coulomb to the external circuit is V
- Energy converted from chemical to electrical potential energy per coulomb in a cell is E
- Current is I
- Energy dissipated per coulomb in the internal resistance is r

*Forming batteries*
- Cells are often connected in series to produce a larger emf
- Emf of battery = sum of emfs of cells 
- Internal resistance of a battery = sum of internal resistance of cells
- Positive must be connected to negative 
- If a cell is connected the wrong way it counts as negative emf
