**Current :** the rate of flow of charge, also could be defined the charge passing per unit time through the cross section of the conductor

**Charge :** the quantity of electrical charge carried past a given point when a steady current of 1 amp flows for 1 second $$I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$$*Where :*
- Charge is represented by $Q$
- Current is represented by $I$
- Time is represented by $t$

**Current - [[Graphs|Time Graphs]] :**
- Shows the variation in current over time
- Since $Q = I\Delta t$, the area under the graph is total charge
