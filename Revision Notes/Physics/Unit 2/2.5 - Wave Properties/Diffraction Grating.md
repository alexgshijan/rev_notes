These are clear and opaque strips that are equally spaced. *The important features of a grating is that there is hardly any light except at certain angles*
$$n\lambda=d\sin\theta$$*where :*
- Wavelength is $\lambda$ with units $m$
- Distance between slits is $d$ with units $m$
- Order of maxima is $n$
