*A stationary wave is a pattern of disturbances in a medium in which energy is not propagated.* The amplitude of particle oscillations is zero at equally spaced nodes

*Nodes have 0 amplitude, antinodes have maximum amplitude*

| Amplitude constant for progressive waves as we go through the medium. | Amplitude varies smoothly between maxima at antinodes and minima at nodes. (maxima Î»/2 apart) |
| Phase changes steadily with distance for [[Progressive Waves]]        | Phase reverses at nodes but is otherwise constant for stationary waves                        |
| Progressive waves transfer energy through medium                      | Stationary waves do not transfer energy through a medium.                                     |

*Stationary Waves have different modes of vibration, we call these harmonics*
