**Trace Tables**
Useful for keeping track of the values that change in an algorithm, used for debugging, because you can write down what you expect the values to be and compare it with whatâ€™s actually happening. This can help debug logic errors.

**Sorting Algorithms**
- Bubble - Iterates through the list and switches adjacent items if they're in the wrong order.
- Merge - Uses the concept that merging two sorted list, you just need to compare the first values of the two lists and that a list of only one value is "sorted".
- Insertion - Take values from the unsorted list and insert it into a new sorted list at the correct position
- Quick sort - Choose a value on the list and split items bigger and smaller onto the two sides, that pivot is in the correct place. Repeat recursively with remaining values

**Searching Algorithms**
- Binary - Find the midpoint, compares to the value we want to find, removes the half of the list that is outside range.
- Linear - Iterates through every value
- Binary Tree - Uses binary tree logic to transverse the tree.
- Shortest Path
