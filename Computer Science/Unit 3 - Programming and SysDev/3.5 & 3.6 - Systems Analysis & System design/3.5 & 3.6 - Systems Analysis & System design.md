**Waterfall**
The idea with waterfall is that there are distinct stages or “milestones” to the project, and only once a stage is finished can the whole team move on to the next stage. Everything needs to be planned extensively at the beginning and then followed carefully. It also means that something deliverable is produced at the end of each stage which helps inform the next stage and clearly documents progress through the system lifecycle

*Pros*
- Because the design is really thorough and documentation is detailed at each stage, employee turnover would not cause problems with development 
- The client also knows exactly what to expect – they’ll know up front the size, cost and timeline. This makes the feasibility study a lot easier, and means everyone knows what the deadlines for milestones are so that progress can be constantly evaluated

*Cons*
- Because of the heavy reliance on the initial design requirements, if there are faults or flaws in this then the entire project might need to be scrapped or restarted with new requirements
- This is a very rigid process with no room for change or flexibility to work around major errors
- It can be difficult to know exactly how to design the program perfectly from the start – maybe the clients don’t know exactly what they want, or maybe the developers don’t know how to achieve it 
- Fewer opportunities for client interaction – they are only involved at set times in the process

**Agile**
This approach is centred on the belief that the programmer knows best and should just be given the tools and resources they need to get the job done effectively - agile allows the developers to move between different stages fluidly depending on the developing needs of the project as it progresses.

This is known as 'iterative' development, as the design and analysis stages can inform each other back and forth, with multiple new 'iterations' or versions of the project being produced

Developers start off with a fairly basic design which is not very fleshed out, and begin to work on small modules which could relate to any of the development stages. The work is done in 'sprints' – short development cycles of a week or a month, and at the end of each sprint the project priorities are re-evaluated and tests are carried out

There is considerably less documentation produced with the agile project approach due to the focus on programming. More time programming theoretically means a better end product, although sometimes a bit of paperwork can help the process in terms of visualising things, and without sufficient paperwork a new member of staff or future maintenance workers might struggle to get a good understanding of the system

*Pros*
- Sprints allow for bugs to be discovered at each small stage rather than all in one go at the end
- They also allow clients/customers regular interaction to provide feedback on each stage and have flexibility over what the final project looks like – maybe they didn’t know exactly what they wanted in the first place, or decide midway through development that their needs have changed. Agile can meet these needs, waterfall can’t
- Parts of the system can be designed or re-designed on the fly. Parts of the program can be rewritten as required.
- It also allows for new features to be added which weren’t necessarily part of the original idea, or if new technologies emerge during the lifetime of the project they can potentially be incorporated in to the project

*Cons*
- Development could theoretically take longer if the goals are constantly being changed or the program is being tinkered with, but it could also be a lot quicker to reach a point where a releasable product has been created – a new updated version could always be released later on
- Likewise, the project could end up way over budget as there was no clear idea at the start of how long it would take how much it would cost
