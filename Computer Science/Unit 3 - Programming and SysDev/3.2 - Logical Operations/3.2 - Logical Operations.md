**NAND** - This is Not And, so it outputs 0 when both inputs are on 

**NOR** - This is Not Or, so it outputs 0 when any inputs are 1

**De Morgan's Laws**
$$'(A+B)= \bar{A}\cdot \bar{B}\hspace{1cm}'(A\cdot B)= \bar{A}+ \bar{B}$$
Truth Table Proof :

| A   | B   | A+B | AB  | '(A+B) | 'A  | 'B  | 'A'B | '(AB) | 'A+'B |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ------ | --- | --- | ---- | ----- | ----- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1      | 1   | 1   | 1    | 1     | 1     |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0      | 1   | 0   | 0    | 1     | 1     |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0      | 0   | 1   | 0    | 1     | 1     |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 0      | 0   | 0   | 0    | 0     | 0     |
