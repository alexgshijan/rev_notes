**These are specific sets of rules which are effectively an agreed way of doing things** - they give devs common ground when developing software, defining the manner in which programs are written and how syntax should appear

**Benefits of Standards**
- Portability - Will run on different machines without needing to be modified for different operating systems or hardware etc.
- Documentation - Thorough documentation which helps programmers know exactly how to implement certain things
- Maintenance - When programs written by one person have to be modified, if a standard has been used then maintenance will not be an issue
- Employment - Programmers can apply for any job that requires knowledge of that particular language knowing that they have the correct technical skills
- Developing other products - If they use a standard program language for a new platform, other devs can create products for that platform

**Difficulties with creating Standards**
- Bias - Standards cannot be biased towards a particular hardware manufacturer or operating system
- Organisation - Multiple different opinions and solutions must be considered and discussed
- Thoroughness - Standards have to be thorough in how they define whatever it is they relate to
- Regulations - Regulatory bodies  have to have certain conditions satisfied before new standards can be accepted, new standards can be difficult to implement
- Limiting development - Developers may find that a standard does not adequately allow them to complete a task in the way they would like to
- Documentation - Because documentation is written in a natural language, some ambiguities may still arise
