Allows you to run code in an emulated version of your target environment.

**Types of Error**
- Runtime - Program crashed in the running of the program.
- Logical - Where the program doesn't function as intended.
- Syntax - Where the program doesn't follow the set rules of the language.

**Version Management**
This a way to keep track of changes within code over time, creating alternate copies to test with and to allow users to remain up to date with your code as you make updates.

**Case (Computer Aided Software Engineering) Tools**
Tools that provide functions to assist with the designing, developing and testing of new software. These can be split up into uppercase (design) and lowercase tools (creation).

**Examples of CASE tools**
- Data Dictionary - Automatic generation of data structure tables based on input
- Diagram Production - Easy creation of a variety of different diagrams
