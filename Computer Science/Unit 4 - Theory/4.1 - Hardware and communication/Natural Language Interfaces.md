**Application of Voice Input**
Information Systems and Steering Calls - a  phone system directing your call to the appropriate department based on your input.
Biometrics - Using voice input to verify identity by analysing wave patterns in speech
Data input for speech to text or translation

**Advantages of Voice Input**
- Allows users to interact with a computer hands-free and not have to sit or be still to type 
- Intuitive, easy to use. May have some specific commands but these will not be complex
- Could potentially speed up work for slow typers 
- Could be extremely helpful for people with certain physical disabilities or special education needs
- The software might provide corrections if a mistake is detected, although this could slow input down

**Disadvantages**
- Software has to be taught to recognise your voice to provide the best possible service which can take time 
- The accuracy of the software could be reduced in your voice changes due to a cold or if there is a lot of background noise
- Commercial voice recognition software can be expensive and a separate mic might be required
- Strong dialects and accents may cause confusion
- Ambiguity of natural language
