**Parallel Processing**
Amdahl’s law$$\text{Speed Up} =\frac{1}{1-P+\frac{P}{N}}\hspace{1cm}\text{Time taken}=T(1)(1-P+\frac{P}{N})$$
Where 
- P is the fraction of programs that can be parallelised
- N is the number of cores
- T(1) is time taken for 1 core to run the program on its own

**Drawbacks**
Complexity - Writing applications would be more complex.
Hardware - You would need multiple cores.
Memory - Data in the program may need to be duplicated due to the separate processors all needing a copy. This could require large amounts of extra memory
Nature of Problem - Some problems can’t be solved using parallel processing.
