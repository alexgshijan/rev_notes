**Attack Vector**
- Phishing : Emails or messages to employees can contain links to harmful websites which include other vectors, can also act as social engineering, trying to scare users into giving away personal details.
- Drive by download : This is where a legitimate website has been compromised. The user downloads something they believe to be safe and fine, but comes with a hidden issue. Similar to trojan.
- Domain shadowing : Diverting requests to legitimate websites to fake copies of the site. Any downloads/links from this fake site could lead to malware, and data entry forms on these sites can trick the user into giving away personal details
- Malvertising : Malware downloads from infected adverts placed on popular websites
- DDos : Floods a server with fake requests to make it crash. Typically these fake requests are made from a botnet of infected computers, this can either lead to it going down and being unusable or potentially leave it vulnerable to infiltration and other attacks
- SQL Injection : A malicious SQL statement can be entered into a data entry field. This could cause data from the server to be sent to the hacker

**Distribution Method**
- Virus : Malicious software which will deliver a “payload” which will affect the workings of the PC. Spreads across a network via emails, USB sticks etc.  Requires a vector – something to “piggyback” on, and human interaction
- Trojans : Work in a similar way to viruses, but hides in files of programs and activates when these are opened. Often comes with downloads from peer to peer sharing networks. Could create a “backdoor” – remote access to an infected machine for a hacker to access
- Worms : Self replicating malicious software which can spread across secondary storage devices, and even send itself across networks. Doesn’t require a vector. Dangerous, but relatively easy to detect and quarantine

**Malware Payload**
- Spyware : Key presses are tracked and data sent back to the hacker. Used for identity fraud
- Ransomware : Scares the user by threatening to infect their computer or even pretending that the computers are already infected. Ransom-ware deletes / encrypts files and forces users to pay to return the files.
- Remote Access : Computers infected with this can become 'bot' – PCs that a hacker can control to perform an action. Groups of these bots are known as 'botnet'. The hacker can directly control all of these PCs to perform certain actions

**Penetration Testing**
- This is a deliberate attack by a white hat/ethical hacker on a system or network to find the vulnerabilities/weaknesses that could be exploited 
- This can include gaining access to data at different security levels, access to certain software or services in the system, or access to other systems 
- They also test the effectiveness of the organisation’s security policies, including both digital policies and non-digital
- They may also check how good the physical security is – i.e. can they actually get into the building where the data servers are located
- White box approach : hacker has a lot of information about the target system
- Black box approach : hacker only knows the name of the company

**Penetration Techniques**
- Targeted testing : The internal IT team working with external professionals to determine the vulnerability of the company’s systems and find solutions to strengthening the systems to prevent potential attacks.
- Internal testing : Testing systems to establish the extent to which a dissatisfied employee may go to in accessing unauthorised information.
- External penetration testing : Testing to establish the vulnerability to external attackers of an organisations external devices and servers such as firewalls, email-servers and web servers.
- Blind pen testing : An authorised imitation of a real cyber-attack where an ethical hacker is tasked with gaining access to an organisation’s systems.
- Double blind pen testing : Similar to blind testing - determine how fast and effective the security team is on identifying and responding to real attacks.
- Network service tests, web application tests, client side tests, wireless network tests, social engineering tests
