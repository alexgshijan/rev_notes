**Potential issues when updating files online**
- Before updating files, things like disk space and hardware & software  compatibility need to be considered
- Updates are prone to failure for multiple possible reasons 
- Other software can interfere with the update 
- Computer crashing or network connection dropout can cause corruption to the update
- There are many potential issues when installing new software from potentially untrustworthy sources

**Cryptography - Asymmetric encryption**
- This type of encryption uses different keys known as “public” and “private” keys 
- These two keys will be generated by the encryption software being used.
- The public key is distributed to anybody that wants it, but the private key is required to open anything encrypted with the public key.

Symmetric in comparison is faster to compute but vulnerable to snooping and does not scale well.
