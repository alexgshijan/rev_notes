**Techniques**
- Fingerprints : Fingerprints are stored in a database. Highly accurate, well established, widely used
- Retina : The pattern of blood vessels in the eye are unique to each individual and virtually impossible to duplicate, as is the pattern of the iris. Highly accurate, costly equipment required
- DNA : Swabs are taken from suspects and can potentially be quite intrusive. DNA testing is also very costly and can take days or weeks to complete.
- Facial Recognition : A scan of a person’s face is compared with scans in a database. Given that the quality of the image taken is dependent upon factors such as lighting,  quality of camera, changing physical attributes etc, this method is generally not as accurate as the others.
- Speaker Recognition : Slightly different from what we learned about with voice recognition – that was about what is being said, rather than who. Voices are extremely difficult to recreate. A voice print of a person’s speech is taken and attributes such as the frequency, pitch, style and stress determine it’s uniqueness
- Hand Geometry : Multiple measurements are taken of the shape of a user’s hand which are then compared with measurements in a database. Highlight accurate, difficult to use for people with problems such as arthritis. Requires expensive specialist scanning equipment
- Heartbeat : Measuring certain attributes of the heartbeat through an ECG scan including the waveform and other characteristics

**Benefits**
- Unique to individuals, convenient
- More secure, harder to replicate/fool than a simple password
- No need to remember multiple passwords or use security cards which are easily lost/stolen
**Negatives**
- Potentially very expensive equipment required
- Some people find the various scanning processes intrusive
- Some people do not like the fact that their physical data is stored in a database 
- Physical characteristics can change over time 
- Not always accurate.

The two bad cases would be a false positive (authenticates the wrong user) - they get access to the system and false negative (rejects a valid user) - locked out of own system. 

**Perquisites for a valid biometric id.**
- Data needs to be unique for each individual
- Everyone needs to have the data that is going to be collected
- It shouldn’t be overly intrusive
- Whatever data is collected needs to be stored securely
- The data should vary little over time
- It should be impossible to manufacture, forge or fake the data
- The data needs to be measurable and comparable
- The data needs to be stored in such a way that allows to be easily searched and processed

**Capturing, storing and processing biometric data**
1. A user must first be signed up to a system (and agreed to have their biometric data taken for the purposes of identification/authentication)
2. Raw data must be taken using specialist equipment (like a certain camera that takes high quality images of a face). A biometric profile is created from the raw data and stored in a searchable database using a mathematical representation of the sample. 
3. When a scan is taken for identification/authentication, a mathematical representation of the raw data is constructed and compared to files stored in the database.
