This ties in closely with [[Entity Relationship Diagrams]] 

*The following definitions need to be remembered*
**Attributes :**
- Individual pieces of information about entities
- Also known as a “field”
**Record :**
- Each record is a row in a table which contains a collection of *attributes*, showing data about a single entity
**Table :**
- A collection of *records*
- Stores information about an entity
- Also referred to as a “file”
**Database :**
- Collection of one or more *tables*
- A relational database is one in which tables are linked together in some way
- A flat file is where all data is together in one place with no relationships
**Entity :**
- A model of a real world thing we are keeping information about
- Each entity has a certain number of attributes
**Consistency :**
- This is the process of ensuring data is correct after having been processed. Inconsistency can arise from errors in data entry or manipulation issues such as converting to a different unit of measurement for one record and not another 
**Redundancy :**
- This is where a data item appears more than once in a database. This copy is not required and only takes up extra storage space and possibly cause other issues
**Atomic :**
- This means that the data cannot be broken down into any more parts. 
- For example, if you had a “name” field with the data “Joe Horatio Bloggs” it is not atomic because it could be further broken down into “firstname”, “middlename” and “surname”
**Primary Key :**
- A unique identifier consisting of one or more attributes/fields (any more than 1 and it is known as a **compound key**)
- No two records may have the same value for the primary key 
- E.g. a student number, a driving licence number etc.
**Foreign Key :**
- Relational databases have more than 1 table 
- Records from these tables are combined to make a complete record of an entity
- Foreign keys link different records in different tables to show a link between the records
- A foreign key in one table will be a **primary key** in another
**Candidate Key :**
- Any attribute or field that could be considered a viable and suitable primary key
- More than 1 attribute could be unique, so there can be multiple candidate keys
- Eg. Biometrics, Phone Number + Email
**Secondary Key :**
- Enables a user to access data in an order other than the primary key 
- Also enables filtering of search results 
- Done through the creation of a secondary index files 
- This can make searching through large numbers of files easier
**Normalisation :**
- Flat files are considered not normalised (non-normal form), whereas relational databases can be normalised (1st, 2nd, or 3rd normal form) to reduce data redundancy and the chances of data inconsistency.
**Queries :**
- A database operation
