**Searching is done linearly, every value is searched through for a match**
This is the slowest of the file types 

*New records/data always added to the end of the file*
Deleting data from a serial file is either done by deleting every record from the end until you delete the one you’re looking for, or just deleting the one you want and leaving a gap in the file. Either way, it’s not very efficient!
