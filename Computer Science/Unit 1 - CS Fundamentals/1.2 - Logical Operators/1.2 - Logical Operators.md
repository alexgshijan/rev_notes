**Logic in Registers**
*Masking - Checking Bits*
Letâ€™s say we have a register with unknown contents, but we only need to check a specific bit values. *We use the AND gate with the bit pattern 10000000*(Using the example of wanting the MSB in an 8 bit register. The 1 values could go in any position) because we are only interested in those value

*Adjusting Registers*
To go from a cleared register to a new value, we can use *0 Or New-Value*, this would always output the New Value.

*Clearing Registers*
Once the data in a register has been used, it needs to be cleared. We can do this by using *- And 0* for every value in the register. This would always give us an output of 0.

*XOR Symmetric Encryption*
Use an encryption key (another bit pattern) and the XOR logic gate. We can then send our encrypted data and the key (usually separately), and when the receiver gets it they apply XOR and the key to the encrypted data to retrieve the original number.
