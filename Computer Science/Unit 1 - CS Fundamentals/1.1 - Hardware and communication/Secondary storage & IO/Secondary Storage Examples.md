Magnetic : 
- Magnetic storage is still regularly used as a backup technique for businesses because it is able to store large amounts of data relatively cheaply
- Access the data stored on a tape is [[Serial|serial]] -  You can’t go straight to a particular part, you have to go through the storage from the first unit until you find the one you want
- Hard disk drives are an example of magnetic storage : 
	- It consists of layers of physical disks and a read/write head on an actuator arm which houses a small magnet
	- The disks spin incredibly fast, and the read/write head moves across the surface of the disk at enormous speeds

Optical :
- This works by using a laser and examining the reflection 
- Direct access rather than serial, so faster than magnetic but not as fast as flash 
- Cheap form of memory, however it's limited in size

Flash / Solid State : 
- Unlike HDDs they have no moving parts, so are more easily portable without damaging the internal parts
- They can be read from/written to considerably faster than the other two types of secondary storage, and actually consume less power
- Expensive, but becoming more commercially available 
- SSDs are typically now used to store the operating system on a modern PC. This means they can boot up exceptionally quickly
