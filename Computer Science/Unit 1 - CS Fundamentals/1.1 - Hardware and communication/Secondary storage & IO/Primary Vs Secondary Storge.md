Primary : 
- This type of storage is almost always internal
- It is memory that is directly accessed by the CPU
- May be volatile

Secondary : 
- Memory which is not accessed directly by the CPU
- These devices are “non-volatile”, so when the power is turned off the data is not lost (unlike RAM)
- Such devices are used for long term storage and can be used for backing up files and applications, transporting them and sharing them
