A utility is a relatively small program provided by the operating system that has one purpose, usually concerned with the maintenance of the system.

*Anti-virus & firewall programs:* Viruses are malicious programs, often designed to harm a computer system in some way and spread to others. Anti-virus software detects, quarantines and removes viruses. Firewalls monitor network traffic and can automatically block connections. 
*Disk defragmentation:* Disk defragmentation utilities ensure that files are stored together in one place rather than in parts scattered across the hard drive. This helps stop the computer slowing down.
*Compression:* Compression programs reduce the amount of space data takes up in storage. 
*File managers*: Allow files and directories to be moved, copied, deleted and renamed.
*Backup:* Allow back-ups to be automatically made regularly of specified data.
