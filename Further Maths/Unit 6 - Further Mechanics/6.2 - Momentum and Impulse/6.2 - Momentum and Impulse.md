![[3.1 - Momentum and Impulse]]

**Oblique Impacts**
So far we have covered central impacts, were particles collide and their direction of motion are along the line of impact. However utilising vectors we can now start to simulate impacts where the direction of motion is at an angle to the line of impact. It is important to consider where the line of impact is and to ignore components out of scope (perpendicular).
