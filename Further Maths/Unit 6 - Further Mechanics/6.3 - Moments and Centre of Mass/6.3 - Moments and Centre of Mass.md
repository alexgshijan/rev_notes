To find the centre of mass of a system of particles, you need to consider that the effect of the system of particles. **Moment of the whole mass at the centre of mass = sum of moments of the individual masses**
$$m_{T}\bar{x}=m_{1}x_{1}+m_{2}x_{2}$$
**Centre of mass of a lamina**
The mass here is negligible, and so we consider the centre of it's area instead using it's area as a substitute for mass and it's dimensions.

**3D Objects**
**For a rotation about the x axis the volume of the disc is $\pi y^{2}\delta x$ and it's moment is $\pi y^{2}\delta x\cdot x$. The volume of the whole solid is given by $V\bar{x}$, which is equal to $\int{\pi y^{2}\delta x}$**. 
For a rotation about the y axis, switch the x for y.
