To find the centre of mass of a system if particles, you need to consider that the effect of the system of particles. **Moment of the whole mass at the centre of mass = sum of moments of the individual masses**
$$m_{T}\bar{x}=m_{1}x_{1}+m_{2}x_{2}$$
**Centre of mass of a lamina**
The mass here is negligible, and so we consider the centre of it's area instead using it's area as a substitute for mass and it's dimensions.
