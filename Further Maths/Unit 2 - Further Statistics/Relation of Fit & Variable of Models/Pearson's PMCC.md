*The Pearson’s Product Moment Correlation Coefficient (PMCC) allows us to measure the extent by which two variables are correlated. The quantity, r, provides a standardised measure of correlations.* The value of your PMCC allows you to interpret the type of correlation and the strength of correlation. It can take any value from ‐ 1 to + 1.
$$r=\frac{\sum\limits{x_{i}y_{i}}-\frac{\sum\limits{x_{i}}\sum\limits{y_{i}}}{n}}{\sqrt{(\sum\limits {x^2_{i}}-\frac{(\sum\limits{x_{i})^{2}}}{n})\cdot(\sum\limits {y^2_{i}}-\frac{(\sum\limits{y_{i})^{2}}}{n})}}$$
**Calculator Method**
- Stats Menu, add your XY data
- Calc -> 2-Var gives you all the sum values
- Graph -> X -> ax+b gives you the r values
The Mark Scheme will allow you to list the summations, however they need proof of you putting together the final formula for r listed above.

**Hypothesis Testing with the PMCC**
- Only valid for data drawn from a normal bivariate distribution - indicated by an elliptical scatter graph
- We cannot give categorical statements, only if there is enough evidence to suggest

*Steps :*
- Write down the null and alternative hypothesis using p for the Population Correlation Coefficient. Include the definition of p
- Write the significance level 
- Calculate the Product Moment Correlation Coefficient, r
- Look up the critical value from the table, state value of n, the significance level and whether it is one or two tail.
- Compare in writing the value of r with the critical value. If the magnitude of r is less than critical, accept $H_{0}$, if it is greater than the critical, reject $H_{0}$
- State whether to accept or reject $H_{0}$ using language like "there is evidence to suggest that..."
