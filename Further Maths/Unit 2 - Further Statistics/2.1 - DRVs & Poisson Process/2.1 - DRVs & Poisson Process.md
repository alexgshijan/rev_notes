**Discrete Random Variables**
The probability of each individual event is in between 0 and 1, as such we can derive ranges of solutions where an otherwise discrete value is not clear
$$\text{The Expected Value }E(x):\mu=\sum\limits{}{x_{i}p_{i}}\hspace{0.5cm}\text{Total Probability: }1=\sum\limits{}{p_{i}}$$
*where i represents each discrete result*

**[[Standard Deviation]]**
$$Var(x)=E(x^{2})-(E(x))^{2}\to\sigma=\sqrt{E(x^{2})-(E(x))^{2}}$$

**Combinations of Random Variables** - *Where X and Y are random variables*
*Expected Value with defined relation between X and Y* $$E(aX+b)=aE(X)+b$$
*Variance with defined relation between X and Y* $$Var(aX+b)=a^{2}Var(X)$$
*Summing Expected Value :* $$E(aX+bY)=aE(X)+bE(Y)$$
