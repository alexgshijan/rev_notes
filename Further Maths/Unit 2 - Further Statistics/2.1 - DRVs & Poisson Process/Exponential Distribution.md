This calculates the time between events. *The conditions for the exponential distribution to be used are the same as those for the [[Poisson Distribution]], where lambda represents how many events occur per unit time and where x represents time between events.* $$f(x)=\lbrace{\matrix{\lambda e^{-\lambda x}\hspace{1cm}\text{for }x\geq0\\0\hspace{1.9cm}\text{otherwise}}}\implies F(x)=1-e^{-\lambda x}\hspace{1cm}\text{for }x\geq0$$
*Variance and Excepted Value :*$$E(x)=\frac{1}{\lambda}\hspace{2cm}Var(x)=\frac{1}{\lambda^{2}}$$
