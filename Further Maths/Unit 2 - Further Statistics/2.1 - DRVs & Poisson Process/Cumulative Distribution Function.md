**The cumulative distribution F(x) gives the probability that X is less than or equal to a certain value of x given by the formula :** $$F(x)=P(X\leq x)=\int\limits_{a}^{x}f(PDF)\hspace{0.25cm}dx$$*where a is the lowest value in the range. Ensure that you specify the range*

Note that we can find P(y < x < z) by F(z) - F(y)

**Medians, quartiles and percentiles**
- The nth percentile, pn, of X : $F(p_{n})$ = n% written as decimal
- Median would be 0.5, upper quartile 0.75 and lower 0.25
