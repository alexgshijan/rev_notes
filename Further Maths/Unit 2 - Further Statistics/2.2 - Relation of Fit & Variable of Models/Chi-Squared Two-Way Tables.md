We are to take the observed data to form an expected frequencies model, assuming that the two event are independent.

**This measures how far apart a set of observed frequencies are from set expected from the null hypothesis is the X^2 / Chi-Squared statistic.**
$$X^{2}=\Sigma{\frac{(O_{i}-E_{i})^{2}}{E_{i}}}$$
**Varying Degrees of Freedom**
For a matrix $m\cdot n$, the degree of freedom is $(m-1)(n-1)$

**Hypothesis Test**
If critical value at that significance level is less than calculated value of X^2, then there is evidence to suggest an association between the two events.

**Expected Values**
On the calculator, using the Statistics, Test, Chi, Two Way and plotting your values into the matrixes allow you to find expected values.

**Pooling**
If the expected frequencies of a category is less than 5 then it is recommended you pool them together with other frequencies.
