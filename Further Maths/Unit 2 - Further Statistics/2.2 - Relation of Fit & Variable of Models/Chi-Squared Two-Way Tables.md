We are to take the observed data to form an expected frequencies model, assuming that the two event are independent.

**This measures how far apart a set of observed frequencies are from set expected from the null hypothesis is the X^2 / Chi-Squared statistic.**
$$X^{2}=\Sigma{\frac{(O_{i}-E_{i})^{2}}{E_{i}}}$$
**Varying Degrees of Freedom**
For a matrix $m\cdot n$, the degree of freedom is $(m-1)(n-1)$
