**General Method**
1. Determine which distribution would conceptually be most appropriate (e.g. Binomial, Poisson). Quite often you are told which one to use in the question.
2. Set significance level. Again, you are usually told this in the question.
3. Estimate parameters (if necessary) from observed data.
4. Form hypotheses H0 and H1
5. Calculate expected frequencies.
6. Combine any expected frequencies so that none are < 5 (pooling)
7. Find degrees of freedom.
8. Find critical value of Ï‡ from table.
9. Calculate $X^{2}=\Sigma{\frac{(O_{i}-E_{i})^{2}}{E_{i}}}$
10. See if value is significant and draw conclusion.

Note that we minus one from our degree of freedom for every parameter we estimate.

To estimate the parameter we can use the observed values provided to calculate a mean and then a probability value.
