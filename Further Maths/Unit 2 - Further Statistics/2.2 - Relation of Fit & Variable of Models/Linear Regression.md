**Random Vs Non-Random Variable**
We minimise the total of the squares of residuals (error between the y value predicted by the model vs data), known as the least squares regression line.

**Formula for the numerical line of best fit - One Random Variable**
$$y=\bar{y}+\frac{\sum\limits{x_{i}y_{i}}-\frac{\sum\limits{x_{i}}\sum\limits{y_{i}}}{n}}{\sqrt{(\sum\limits {x^2_{i}}-\frac{(\sum\limits{x_{i})^{2}}}{n}}}(x-\bar{x})$$
As such we can understand that the residual is the difference between the plotted value the value using x at that point in the line of best fit formula.

**Calculator Method**
- Input the ranks of as value in the list 
- CALC -> REG -> X -> a+bx -> a and b values are listed.

**Two Random Variables**
You can form two regression lines, $x=a+by$ and $y=a+bx$. Just use the same setup for the equation, just switching the original x-s for y-s
