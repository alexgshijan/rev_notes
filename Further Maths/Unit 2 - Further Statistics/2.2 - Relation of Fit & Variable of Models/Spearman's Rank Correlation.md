**Used when we want to compare two sets of related data using rank order.**
$$r_{s}=1-\frac{6\Sigma d^{2}_{i}}{n(n^{2}-1)}$$
*where $d_{i}=x_{i}-y_{i}$ and n is the number of cases.*

Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is the PMCC applied to the ranks of the data.

**Calculator Method**
- Input the ranks of as value in the list 
- CALC -> REG -> X -> ax+b -> r is the correlation coefficient.

**Hypothesis Testing with Spearman's Rank Correlation**
We cannot use the letter p / correlation, instead we use the word "association". Outside it can be used in the same way as [[Pearson's PMCC]].
