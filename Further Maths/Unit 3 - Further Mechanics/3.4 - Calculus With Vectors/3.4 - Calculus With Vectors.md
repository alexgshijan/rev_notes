**Colliding objects and Closest Approach** 
First we equate the i and j components to see if there is a value where the two vectors are equal ie. colliding. For example, where $A:\pmatrix{3+2t\\5t-4}\hspace{1cm}B:\pmatrix{1-t\\2+3t}$
$$A^{\to}B=B-A=\pmatrix{1-t-(3+2t)\\2+3t-(5t-4)}=\pmatrix{-2-3t\\6-2t}$$
*Note that if the two objects are colliding, there must be a value of t when $A^{\to}B$ is 0, it is likely the question will ask that t off us. Otherwise we will be asked to calculate the minimum distance between the two points.*
$$|A^{\to}B|=\sqrt{(-2-3t)^{2} +(6-2t)^{2}}=d\implies d^{2}=(-2-3t)^{2} +(6-2t)^{2}$$
We would next differentiate 
$$\frac{\delta d^{2}}{\delta t}=2\cdot-3(-2-3t) +2\cdot-2(6-2t)=12+18t-24+8t=26t-12$$
To find the minimum value, we set the differentiate to 0
$$26t-12=0\implies t=\frac{12}{26}$$
*Finally sub in t to our original equation of AtoB to find our closest distance*
