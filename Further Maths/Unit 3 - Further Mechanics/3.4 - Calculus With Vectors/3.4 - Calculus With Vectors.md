**Colliding objects and Closest Approach** #wip 
First we equate the i and j components to see if there is a value where the two vectors are equal ie. colliding. For example, where $A:\pmatrix{3+2t\\5t-4}\hspace{1cm}B:\pmatrix{1-t\\2+3t}$
$$A^{\to}B=B-A=\pmatrix{1-t-(3+2t)\\2+3t-(5t-4)}=\pmatrix{-2-3t\\6-2t}$$
*Note that if the two objects are colliding, there must be a value of t when $A^{\to}B$ is 0, it is likely the question will ask that t off us. Otherwise we will be asked to calculate the minimum distance between the two points.*
$$|A^{\to}B|=\sqrt{(-2-3t)^{2} +(6-2t)^{2}}=$$
