**Assume e^x can be written in the form $e^{x}=a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{3}x^{3}+...$**

To solve first let x=0 $$e^{0}=a_{0}=1\therefore e^{x}=1+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{3}x^{3}+...$$
By differentiating this series, let x=0 & recursively work through terms
$$\frac{d}{dx}(e^{x})=e^{x}=a_{1}+2a_{2}x^{1}+3a_{3}x^{2}+...\implies e^{0}=a_{1}=1$$
By following the pattern we can derive that a_2 = 2, a_3 = 6, a_4 = 24. Alternatively we could present them as 2!, 3! and 4! respectively.

*As such we can define e^x as the following :*
$$e^{x}=\frac{x^{0}}{0!}+\frac{x^{1}}{1!}+\frac{x^{2}}{2!}+\frac{x^{3}}{3!}+...+\frac{x^{r}}{r!}\text{  for all values of x, r lim to infinity}$$
