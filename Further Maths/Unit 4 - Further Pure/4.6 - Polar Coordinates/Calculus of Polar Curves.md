**For the curve $r=f(\theta)$, $\frac{dr}{d\theta}$ gives the rate of change of r as theta changes**

To find the equation of the tangent or normal to the curve at a point on the curve we need to know $\frac{dy}{dx}$ $$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{\frac{dy}{d\theta}}{\frac{dx}{d\theta}}$$
**Integrating for the area of polar shapes using sectors**
$$Area=\int_{a}^{b} \frac{r^{2}}{2}\hspace{0.2cm}\delta\theta$$
Note that you cannot just integrate the whole range of 0 to 2pi as there may be negative solutions we don't inherently want to include.
