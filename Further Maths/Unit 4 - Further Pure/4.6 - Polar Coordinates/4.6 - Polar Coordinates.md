**The polar coordinates of the point P are \[r, $\theta$]**; where: 
- r = OP, the distance of P from the pole 
- $\theta$ = anticlockwise angle at the origin from the initial line to the line OP

**Converting between cartesian and polar, we have the following identities**
- $r^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}$
- $\tan\theta=\frac{y}{x}$
- $y=r\cos\theta$
- $x=r\sin\theta$

You can use the table to find (magnitude) values of different points along a curve and plot it using the help of the polar mode within the graphical calculator. WJEC only recognises values of r > or equal to 0.
