**The polar coordinates of the point P are \[r, $\theta$]**; where: 
- r = OP, the distance of P from the pole 
- $\theta$ = anticlockwise angle at the origin from the initial line to the line OP

**Converting between cartesian and polar, we have the following identities**
- $r^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}$
- $\tan\theta=\frac{y}{x}$
- $y=r\cos\theta$
- $x=r\sin\theta$

You can use the table to find (magnitude) values of different points along a curve and plot it using the help of the polar mode within the graphical calculator. 
WJEC only recognises values of r > or equal to 0. By using $\frac{|fx| + fx}{2}$ we can get only positive solutions on our graphing calculator.

**Special Polar Graphs**
*Circles*
- $r=a$ is a circle where a is the diameter of the circle that is centred on the origin
- $r=a\cos\theta$ is a circle where a is the diameter of the circle that has it's left-most edge at the pole.
- $r=a\sin\theta$ is a circle where a is the diameter of the circle that has it's bottom-most edge at the pole.

*Limaçons* - $r=a\pm b\sin\theta$ and $r=a\pm b\cos\theta$, where a, b > 0
The ratio of a/b will determine the exact shape of the limaçon
- $\frac{a}{b} \leq 1$ forms a cardioid
- $1\lt \frac{a}{b} \lt 2$ forms a wobbly circle
- $\frac{a}{b} \gt 2$ forms a circle

*Roses* - $r=a\sin n\theta$ or $r=a\cos n\theta$, where a $\neq$ 0 and n is an integer > 1
They are called rose curves because the loops that are formed resemble petals. The number of petals that are present will depend on the value of n. The value of a will determine the length of the petals

*Lemniscates* - $r^{2}=a^{2}\sin 2\theta$ or $r^{2}=a^{2}\cos\theta$, where a $\neq$ 0
These are generally shaped like propellers.

**Finding the polar equation of a polar shape**
**Cartesian Method**
- Eq of a circle : $(x-a)^{2}+(y-b)^{2}=radius^{2}$
- Sub in values for a, b and radius 
- expand and simplify for polar equation, r, using identities $x = r\cos\theta$, $y = r\sin\theta$

**Polar Method**
- You can create a right angle triangle with side radius and side r to P.
- Use trig identities to form an equation for the side r to P.
