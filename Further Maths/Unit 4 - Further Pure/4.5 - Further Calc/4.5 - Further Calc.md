Note that when there is an x^2 in the denominator of an integral, we can integrate it into an inverse trigonometric function. We can in fact use another variable to make it easier to arrange in this form. With definite integrals, we can combine the two terms using the equal ln forms of the [[4.7 - Hyperbolic Functions]]
