First we'll find the complimentary function using the method laid out in [[2nd Order Differential Equations]] as though it is homogeneous, and then find the particular function

In the Form : $$A\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}+ B\frac{dy}{dx}+Cx=F(t)$$

**Finding the particular integral**
Make a trial substitution into the LHS. Then compare coefficients with the RHS to find values of C and D.

*Possible Substitutions*
- When LHS is constant : $x=C$
- When LHS is linear function : $x = Ct + D$
- When LHS is linear function and RHS no terms of $x$ : $x=Ct^{2}+Dt$
- When LHS is Quadratic function : $x=Cx^{2}+Dx+E$
- When LHS is exponential contain $e^{px}$ : $x=Ce^{px}$
- When LHS involves $\sin px$ or $\cos px$ : $x=C\cos px+D\sin px$

General solution is the Complimentary Function + Particular Integral Function.
