Recall [[1.3 - Matrices]]

**Minors**
The minor of an element in a 3 × 3 matrix is the determinant of the 2 × 2 matrix that remains after the row and column containing that element have been crossed out.

**Cofactor**
For the element $a_{ij}$ in a matrix, the cofactor is the *minor* * $-1^{i+j}$ (the place sign) in that in a 3x3 matrix, the place sign are as such : $\pmatrix{+&-&+\\-&+&-\\+&-&+}$
**Adjugate Matrix**
This is the matrix of all *cofactors* transposed (swap rows and columns)

**Determinant**
The determinant of a 3 x 3 array can be find by taking the sum of elements times it's *cofactor* in any row or column of an array

**Inverse**
Multiply the inverse of the determinant by the Adjugate Matrix, as shown below
$$A^{-1}=\frac{1}{det(A)}C^{T}$$
