**Improper Integral**
An improper integral is a definite integral for which the integrand (the expression to be integrated) is undefined either at one or both of the limits of integration, or at some point between the limits of integration. Some improper integrals can be evaluated, others cannot. 

For improper integrals with limits involving infinity, you replace the limit of infinity with a variable, work out the value of the integral in terms of the variable, and then look at what happens as the value of the variable tends to infinity.

If the integrand is undefined at a point between the limits, you need to split the integral into two parts, so that the problem value is a limit of both parts, and then use the technique above where the variable is the undefined bound.

**The Mean Value of a Function**
The mean value of the function y = f(x) over the interval \[a, b] is given by :
$$\bar y =\frac{1}{b-a}\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx$$
