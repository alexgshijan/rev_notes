Recall [[1.3 - Matrices]]

**Minors**
The minor of an element in a 3 × 3 matrix is the determinant of the 2 × 2 matrix that remains after the row and column containing that element have been crossed out.

**Cofactor**
For the element $a_{ij}$ in a matrix, the cofactor is the minor * $-1^{i+j}$ (the place sign) in that in a 3x3 matrix, the cofactors are as such : $\pmatrix{+&-&+\\-&+&-\\+&-&+}$

**Determinant** - "Expanding the First Row"
The determinant of a 3 x 3 array can be find by taking the sum of elements times it's cofactor in any row or column of an array
