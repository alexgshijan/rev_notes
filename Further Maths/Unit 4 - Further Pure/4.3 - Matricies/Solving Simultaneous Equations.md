**Method 1**
Where $A=\pmatrix{a&b\\c&d}$ from the simultaneous equations $ax+by=e$ and $cx+dy=f$
$$A\pmatrix{x\\y}=\pmatrix{e\\f}\implies A^{-1}A\pmatrix{x\\y}=A^{-1}\pmatrix{e\\f}$$
By multiplying the A inverse with $e,f$ we get values for $x,y$

If the two equation are contradictory, the equations are said to be inconsistent. In other cases where the equations overlap either infinitely or at a point, these are consistent. This can be observed by inspection, which is hard w/ multiple equations.

The Method can also be expanded to work with $x,y,z$
