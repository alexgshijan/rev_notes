As we can see below, the integrals of each of these are quite convenient for us.
$$\int\cosh kx\hspace{0.1cm}dx=\frac{1}{k} \sinh kx+ C\hspace{0.8cm}\int\sinh kx\hspace{0.1cm}dx=\frac{1}{k} \cosh kx+ C\hspace{0.8cm}\int\sec h^{2}\hspace{0.1cm} kx\hspace{0.1cm}dx=\frac{1}{k} \tanh kx+ C$$

**Recall the methods from unit 3 used to differentiate the inverse trig formulae**
