*The angle between a line and a place can be found using the direction vector of the line and the normal vector to the plane*

Things of note :
- $\alpha$ , the angle between the line and the plane is $90-\theta$, where theta is the angle between the line and the normal 
- If $\theta>90$ then the vector may have the opposite polarity. $180-\theta$ gives us our correct solution
