**$\bar{X}$ modelled with the distribution $N(\micro,\frac{\sigma^{2}}{n})$** $\to$ same variables as [[Normal Distribution]] 

When hypothesis testing with this distribution, since tails are identical, we can just double the critical values

*Also, as part of hypothesis testing, we can find the values at the critical regions and then see if our value exceeds those bounds. This is a simpler method*

We use this when we've already been given a variance and mean from a normal dataset
