*If a continuous function f with an interval a b as it's domain, takes values f(a) and f(b) at each end of the interval, then it also takes any value between f(a) and f(b) at some point within the interval*

Bolzano's theorem expands upon that. It states if a such a function has values of opposite sign within interval, then it has at least one root in that interval.

Which seems like it's just obvious but it's the basis on which the intermediate value theorem is built.

*There are three possible points of failure*
- Where the graph just touches the x axis and so no change of sign occurs
- Where intervals are two large and so areas with opposite sign skipped
- There is a discontinuity in the graph, so roots skipped
