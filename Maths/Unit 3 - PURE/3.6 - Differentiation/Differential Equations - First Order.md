If the rate of *increase* of x is proportional to x:
$$\frac{dx}{dt}=kx$$
If the rate of *decrease* of x is proportional to x:
$$\frac{dx}{dt}=-kx$$
*We can collect the variable to solve differential equations*
$$\frac{dy}{dx}=f(x)$$
*Due to 'maths you'll learn in uni' you're able to treat the dydx as a fraction*
$$dy=f(x)\text{ dx}$$
*Also due to said uni maths, you're able to differentiate both sides with respect to their own variable*
$$\int dy=\int f(x)\text{ dx}$$

By solving this, we can solve for y. If we are given bound rules, we can then work out the constant to get a completed equation. Also note that any terms with y must be brought the the $dy$ side
