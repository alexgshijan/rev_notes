**This model can be used when the probability of each option is equal**
An example of this would be a fair die, there is an equal probability of each side

$p(x)$ for discrete random variables is known as a **probability mass function**, because the probability of each outcome represents an actual ‘amount’ (i.e. mass) of probability.
