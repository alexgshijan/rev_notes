**This is a model that can be used for count data. The random variable $X$ counts the number of times an event occurs in a given amount of space or time.**

**$X$ modelled with the distribution $Po(\lambda)$ :**$$P(X=x)=\frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{x}}{x!}$$*Where :*
- The events occur independently of each other and at random 
- The event occur at a constant rate
- The events occur one at a time
- The mean number of events is represented by $\lambda$

**Note : The space and time frame is proportional to $\lambda$**
