*A polynomial of order $n$  has $n$  solutions, they may just not all be real.*

We can use the discriminant ($b^2-4ac$) to find out what kind of roots a quadratic has.

A discriminant > 0 means the quadratic has 2 unique real solutions, they cross the x axis at two unique points.

*Using the example $x^2+5x+4$, it's discriminant would be $5^2-4\cdot1\cdot4=9$, which is greater than 0. Plotted on the graph we see it has 2 x-intercepts*
```desmos-graph
    y=x^2+5x+4
```


A discriminant = 0 means the quadratic has 1 unique real solutions, they just touch the x axis at one point.

*Using the example $x^2-6x+9$, it's discriminant would be $(-6)^2-4\cdot1\cdot9=0$. Plotted on the graph we see it has 1 x-intercepts*
```desmos-graph
    y=x^2-6x+9
```

A discriminant < 0 means the quadratic has no real solutions, they do not touch the x axis and factorising to find x would require us to work with imaginary numbers.

*Using the example $2x^2+4x+3$, it's discriminant would be $4^2-4\cdot2\cdot3=-10$, which is less than 0. Plotted on the graph we see it has no x-intercepts*
```desmos-graph
    y=2x^2+4x+3
```
