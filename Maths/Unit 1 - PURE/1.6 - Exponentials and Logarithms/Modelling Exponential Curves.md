*When graphing data, it's nice when the data forms a straight line. However generally you won't get this with real world data. This can create an issue when trying to extrapolate data.*

We can fix this by applying log to the y axis, we then attempt to model the data using either $y=ax^{n}$ or $y=ab^{x}$

*Option 1 : $y=ax^{n}$*
- Graph $\log y$ against $\log x$
- Gradient is n
- vertical intercept is $\log a$

*Option 2 : $y=ab^{x}$*
- Graph $\log y$ against $x$
- Gradient is $\log b$
- vertical intercept is $\log a$
